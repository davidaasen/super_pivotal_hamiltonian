\subsection{Ising TQFT}
Here we introduce the Ising TQFT via Kauffamann and Lins\cite{Lins1994}. We choose $A = e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{16}}$, a primitive 16th root of unity. 
We label the identity particle $1$, Ising anyon $\sigma$ and the fermion $\psi$.
The quantum dimensions are
\begin{align}
d_1 = 1 \quad d_\sigma = -A^2 - A^{-2} \quad d_\psi =1 
\end{align}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{folding_A3.pdf}
\caption{Performing the condensation from the Ising theory to the $C_2$ theory. The Dynkin diagram for $A_3$ folds about the node labeled by $\sigma$, producing the Dynkin diagram 
for $C_2$. The first node in the $C_2$ Dynkin diagram is the (fermionic) vacuum, and the second node is $\beta$, the image of $\sigma$ under condensation. } 
\end{figure}


\subsection{Condensate}
In this subsection we describe the structure of the fermionic condensate. 
The condensate will be fermionic in a ver mild sense, roughly speaking we will condense a pair of fermions in the usual way, except one fermion is a physical external fermion, and the other is an emergent fermion such as the $\psi$ particle in the Ising topological order.

The idea is to notice that $1$ and $\psi$ form a fusion sub-algebra of the Ising fusion rules.
We would like to ``condense" the $\psi$ particle by modding out this sub-algebra.
Modding out by this sub-algebra is quite subtle, we are not free to just identify $\mathds{1}$ and $\psi$ since the $\psi$ particle is fermionic in both spin and statistics:
\begin{align}
\Spin = (-1) \times  \PsiIdentity
\qquad \qquad \TwoPsiExchange =  (-1) \times\TwoPsiIdentity
\end{align}
and such a naive identification would result in a trivial theory \dave{Show picture.}
To remedy this, we introduce a spin structure which compensates for the fermionic nature of the $\psi$ particle in the condensate. 
Spin structures will play a large role in the following and so warrant a brief discussion. 
$$
$$
(Insert some discussion on spin structures here?)
$$
$$
Physically, the spin structure can be thought of as a theory of physical fermions, for example a $p+ip$ superconductor.
The condensation process then accounts for taking the emergent fermionic particle, pairing it with the physical fermion and then condensing the bosonic composite particle\dave{Refer to figure.}.

Some of the symmetry of the theory is reduced when we condense the composite particles. 
This is because the spin structure ocurrs along on a two dimensional surface embedded in the TQFT. 
It is useful to introduce some notation for $\psi$ particles that terminate on this defect. 
In Fig.~\ref{BackWall} we denote a $\psi$ world line that goes straight back into the defect by a small box. 
\begin{figure}
  \centering
    \includegraphics{BackWall.pdf}
      \caption{Back wall. \dave{need to number things.}.}
      \label{BackWall}
\end{figure}
Locally these terminations of $\psi$ lines look like
\begin{align}
\PsiFermion 
\end{align}
One can check that the composite of a $\psi$ line terminating on the spin structure is bosonic. Indeed under a twist we have,
\begin{align}
\PsiFermion  \rightarrow \PsiFermionTwist = \PsiFermion 
\end{align}
Where the equality follows from the fact the the $\psi$ particle picks up a minus sign due to its topological spin being minus one, and the rotated spin structure also picks up a minus sign. 
The defect termionations are also bosonic under exchange,
\begin{align}
\TwoFermion \rightarrow \TwoFermionExchange = \TwoFermion
\end{align}
where one minus sign comes from the exchange of the $\psi$ particles, and the other from the exchange of the spin structure fermions \dave{better name?}. 
Although locally this defect behaves as a boson, it is not a usual boson. 
The physical fermion that's attached to it still feels the spin structure. 
Indeed when the box passes over a non-trivial cycle of the manifold it can pick up a factor $\pm1$ depending on the spin structure.  \dave{Need notation from spin structure section.}

\dave{Something about $\text{Pin}^{\pm}$ structures I never understood.}
One should be able to evaluate any pair of fermions terminating at the defect into a complex number.
In order to evaluate the picture into a number we require them to be in a standard form, and denote there evaluation by $\lambda$:
\begin{align}
\PsiEnd  = \lambda \times \text{(vaccuum)}
\label{EvalPsiPsi}
\end{align}
where $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$. 
By defining reflection about the horizontal axis as a conjugate linear operater, we have(\dave{may want to change this to about the vertical axis})
\begin{align}
\lambda^{*} = \left( \PsiEnd \right) ^{\dagger}  = \PsiEndExchange = - \lambda 
\label{phase}
\end{align}
and we see that $\lambda = - \lambda^*$ and therefore $\lambda$ is a purely imaginary number. 
It will depend on whether we choose a $\text{Pin}^{\pm}$ structure \dave{Need to understand these.}. 
For now we pick $\lambda = i$. 

\subsection{isotopies of $\cal{C}/\psi$}
%and so we can condense the $\psi$ particle by modding out this sub-algebra, provided that we introduce the spin structures needed to make this procedure legitimate. 
Now that we have worked out the graphical rules for the condensate we can check what implications it has on the Ising Fusion category.
We will denote this theory by $\cal{C}/\psi$ since we have enforced that the identity object in Ising to be isomorphic to $\psi$.
Many subtelties crop up when one does this. 
We have already seen that it necessitates a spin structure. 
Another subtelty is that multiplication of diagrams as to be modified, indeed we need to account for an equivalence relation arising from the isotopy of the fermionic objects. 
This is largest difference between a super fusion fusion category and a bosonic one.

We first observe that any diagram with a $\psi$ line can be absorbed into the condensate at the expense of a phase by using (\ref{EvalPsiPsi}).
Thus in the target theory the only objects remaining will be $\sigma$ lines with possible fermions attached. 
We will denote the image of $\sigma$ under the condensation procedure as $\beta$, and we will introduce a blue dot as a compact notation for a $\psi$ line that terminates on both $\beta$, and the spin structure. 
Diagrammatically any section of the $\beta$ line may look like
\begin{align}
\FubeXss \qquad \qquad \FubeXsds,
\end{align}
Indeed these are also the generators of the endorphisms of $\beta$.
Since we have one even generator and one odd generator we see that $\text{End}(\beta) \cong \mathbb{C}\ell_1$ \dave{Mention Q type here? Elsewhere? will decide as structure gets put together.}.
These odd endomorphisms already modify the tensor product of the theory, which we discuss below in Section \ref{IsingTensorProduct}


As shown in \ref{phase} the process of removing two fermions results in a phase:
\begin{align}
\SigmaDotDot\; = A^4\; \FubeXss
\end{align}
where we take $A^4 = i$ (although $A^4 = -i$ is also fine). 
Similarly, exchanging the ferimons fermions also results in a minus sign,
\begin{align}
\SigmaDotDot\;  &= - \; \SigmaDotDotExchange.
\end{align}
From the braiding endowed in the parent theory one ends up with some phases due to sliding the fermions past cups and caps in diagrams.
For example, we can compute,
\begin{align}
\DotSlidea =
\DotSlideb =
-A^4\DotSlidec =
-A^4\DotSlided 
\end{align}
Hence we have,
\begin{align}
\CapDotRight\; &= - A^4 \; \CapDotLeft & \CupDotRight\; &=  A^4 \; \CupDotLeft.
\end{align}
These phases can be derived completely from the {\it braiding data} of the Ising theory, and must be such that going around a circular $\beta$ loop gives a factor of $-1$, which enforces the constraint that $A^8 = -1$. In more general examples, the braiding data in the parent theory will not be such that this is the case, this precludes an ability to have $q$-type objects with $\cl_1$ endomorphism algebras. 

\dave{Add some pictures showing why these isotopies are compatible with the spin structure.}

\subsection{Tensor product in $\cal{C}/\psi$}
\label{IsingTensorProduct}
Of the dot representing the fermion is free to slide up and down the diagram. 
This has non-trivial implications on the tensor products, indeed defining the tensor product of the squares above by stacking,
\begin{align}
\FubeXss \otimes \FubeXsds = \overset{\FubeXss}{\FubeXsds} \sim \overset{\FubeXsds }{\FubeXss}
\label{Exampletp}
\end{align}
To the right, we have denoted an equivalent state using isotopy. 
If we are interested in pictures modulo local relations, we should define our tensor product so that it accounts for this equivalence relation. 
For example, naively tensoring over $\mathbb{C}$ can yield the following,
\begin{align}
V^{\beta 1}_\beta \tp_\mathbb{C} V^{\beta 1}_\beta = \overset{\FubeXss}{\FubeXss} \oplus \overset{\FubeXss}{\FubeXsds} \oplus \overset{\FubeXsds}{\FubeXss} \oplus \overset{\FubeXsds_2}{\FubeXsds_1}
\end{align}
from which we naively conclude that the tensor product of the two vector spaces, each which has one even state and one odd state, results in a four dimensional vector space of two even state and two odd states. 
However, it's clear that not all the vectors appearing on the right hand side are linearly independant, indeed the middle two are related by isotopy, and so are the outer two. 
Hence we have to quotient out by isotopy. 

We will incorporate this equivalence relation into the tensor product of the super fusion category.
We are already used to modding out by a similar equivalence relation with the ordinary tensor product of a vector space of the complex numbers. 
Indeed, the analog of shuttling the dot past the junction is shuttling a complex number from one vector to another in a complex vector space we have 
\begin{align}
(\alpha \ket{x}) \tp_\mathbb{C} \ket{y} \sim \ket{x} \tp_\mathbb{C} (\alpha \ket{y}) \quad \forall \alpha \in \mathbb{C}
\end{align}
Similarly in a bosonic fusion category, our vectors are pictures, and the the tensor product glues those pictures together. 

In doing so we have to allow for arbitrary pictures  that matching the boundary conditions to be shuttled past the gluing junction. 
Shuttling a picture past the junction is just an endomorphism of the boundary condition. \dave{Include such abstract stuff? Also who to reference?}
Thus for gluing two pictures $P(Y_i)$ on surfaces $Y_i$  along a boundary $S \in \partial Y_i$ we have the natural extension to \dave{picture.}
\begin{align}
P_{(Y_1, S)} \tp_{\text{End}(S)}P_{(Y_2,S)} \equiv P_{(Y_1,S)} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} P_{(Y_2,S)} /\sim
\end{align}
where the equivalence relation $\sim$ is given by,
\begin{align}
 (P_{(Y_1,S)} \text{End}(S)) \tp_{\mathbb{C}} P_{(Y_2,S)}  \sim P_{(Y_1,S)} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} (\text{End}(S) P_{(Y_2,S)}). 
\end{align}
This formulation of tensor products looks rather abstract, but at the same time familiar from the context of guage theories. 
It is useful to think of the tensoring over endomorphisms as ``integrating" over all gauge field configurations, consistent with the boundary conditions.

In this light, we will implement the ``guage" transformations with a series of isomorphims. 
At the end of the day it is a choice on whether we represent a quantum state by choosing one vector in the equivalence relation, or if we symmetrize over all possible states. 
Indeed, when writing down the string net Hamiltonian we will implement the symmetrization over all states by simply adding those terms to the Hamiltonian. 

Lets revisit the example in (\ref{Exampletp}). 
To tensor product over the endomorphisms of the boundary, which in this case is $\text{End}(\beta)$ we have \dave{obviously we have to clean this up.},
\begin{align}
\FubeXss \otimes_{\text{End}(\beta)} \FubeXsds  = \overset{\FubeXss}{\FubeXss}  / \sim \\
\text{where} 
 \overset{\FubeXss}{\FubeXss}  \sim  \overset{ \FubeXss }{\FubeXss} 
\end{align}
as anticipated.
We are also free to choose a single representative of this equivalence class which, for example
\begin{align}
\FubeXss \otimes_{\text{End}(\beta) }\FubeXsds = \overset{\FubeXss}{\FubeXsds} =  \FubeXsds \otimes_{\text{End}(\beta)}  \FubeXss
\end{align}
At this point, it may appear like we've introduced an unnecessary complication. 
The tensor product we originally looked at in (\ref{Exampletp}) ended up giving the right result. 
However, in the general theory it will be useful to explicitly write down a basis for these endomorphisms to make the pentagon equation explicit.

\subsection{F-symbols}
The F-symbols provide linear relations on diagrams.
Using the F-symbols from the original Ising theory, one can simply infer the linear relations on the diagrams in the condensed theory. 
To do this we first take a diagram in the Ising theory apply an F-move, then remove all $\psi$ lines through condensation. 
For example, we have,
\begin{align}
\TwoLine =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \CupCap +  \CupCapPsi \right) \quad \text{and} \quad \CupCapPsi \rightarrow A^{-4} \CupCapDots
\end{align}
using these relations we can infer all the non-trivial F-moves of the condensed theory:
\begin{align}
\TwoLine\; & = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \CupCap \; + \;A^{-4} \CupCapDots \right) \\
\CupCap \; &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(\TwoLine \; + \; \TwoLineDots \right).
\end{align}
%These are all the linear relations on the diagrams that we get.
By just doing the diagrammatics, we have avoided the subtlety of tensoring over the endomorphisms of $\beta$.
More formally, the F-symbol is a change of basis in the Hom space $V^{abc}_d$ \dave{explained in intro to Ising TQFT?}
\begin{align}
F^{abc}_d: \oplus_x V^{ab}_x \tp_{\text{End}(x)} V^{xc}_d \rightarrow \oplus_y V^{ay}_d \tp_{\text{End}(y)} V^{cd}_y
\end{align}
It is useful to choose an explicit basis for the splitting spaces and use $F$-symbols which are purely complex subject to some constraints, i.e., they must commute with the ``gauage transformations". 
To that end, we pick a basis for the splitting spaces, and explicitly write down the matrices which induce the ``gauage" transformations. 

Hence we will consider all pictures in the ``extended" space $V^{ab}_x \tp_\mathbb{C} V^{xc}_d$, find all solutions to $F$-symbols subject to the constraint that they commute with the endomorphisms. 
Then we will project back into the ``physical" vector space $V^{ab}_x \tp_\text{End}(x) V^{xc}_d$ by symmetrizing over all the gauge transformations.

In the cases of interest, the generators of $\text{End}(x)$ are isomorphisms, lets choose a basis $f_i$ for these isomorphisms.
We wish to solve for 
\begin{align}
V^{ab}_x \tp V^{xc}_d /\prod_i \langle V^{ab}_x f_i \tp V^{xc}_d \sim V^{ab}_x  \tp f_i V^{xc}_d  \rangle
\label{physicalspace}
\end{align}
Lets do this by introducing a set of matrices $M(f_i)$ defined via,
\begin{align}
M(f_i) V^{ab}_x \tp V^{xc}_d = (V^{ab}_x f_i )\tp (f_i^{-1} V^{xc}_d).
\end{align}
Notice that the matrices $M(f_i)$ are always even. 
Hence as a representation they are always of type M.
They are also complex linear in the $f_i$: $M(\alpha f_i + \beta f_j) = \alpha M(f_i) + \beta M(f_j) $ for all $ \alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}$.
Hence the $M(f_i)$ form a finite dimensional matrix algebra, and the physical space in (\ref{physicalspace}) is just an irreducible representation of this matrix algebra. 

The equivalence relation is now simply given by any two vectors related by some complex linear combination of the $M(f_i)$. 
Hence for the $F$-symbol, we require the following diagram to be commutative, 
\begin{align}
	\vcenter{\xymatrix @!0 @M=1mm @R=30mm @C=42mm{
		 \oplus_x V^{ab}_x \otimes V^{xc}_d \ar[d]^{M(f_x)}\ar[r]^{F^{abc}_d}& \oplus_y V^{ay}_d \otimes V^{bc}_y \ar[d]^{M(f_y)} \\
		\oplus_x V^{ab}_x \otimes V^{xc}_d  \ar[r]^{F^{abc}_d}  & \oplus_y V^{ay}_d \otimes V^{bc}_y	
	}} \quad \text{i.e.,} \quad F^{abc}_d M(f_x) = M(f_y) F^{abc}_d
\end{align}
for all $f_x \in \text{End}(x)$ and $f_y \in \text{End}(y)$.
We will return to this in Section??? and describe in more detail. 


\subsection{Center of  $\text{Ising}/\psi$}
The fubes are given by the string configurations 
\begin{align}
\FubeXXX \quad \FubesXs    \quad \FubeXss \quad \FubessX   \quad \FubesdXs \quad  \FubeXsds \quad \FubessdX
\end{align}
Each fube must come equipped with a spin structure, given by an element $\eta \in H^1(C,\zt) \cong \zt$, where $C$ is the cylinder. $\eta$ simply determines the nature of the boundary conditions for fermions which encricle the fube, and so the boundary conditions for fubes must obey a $\zt$ group structure. We have to be a little careful though, as mentioned earlier: contractible fermionic loops that twist fermion ribbons by $2\pi$ are associated with a $-1$ sign, and so the identity element in $H^1(C,\zt)$ corresponds to {\it anti-periodic} (or non-vorex) boundary conditions, with the nontrivial element corresponding to periodic (or vortex) boundary conditions.

We will denote the spin structure of a given fube with a subscript, either $A$ for anti-periodic/non-vortex sector or $P$ for periodic/vortex sector. 
Not every fube is consistent with each spin structure.
For example,
\begin{align}
\FubesdXs_A\;  = - \; \FubesdXs_A 
\end{align}
which follows from pulling the fermion around the boundary and so a minus sign is acquired. 
Meanwhile we have,
\begin{align}
\FubesXs_P \; = \; (A^4)^*\; \FubesXsa_P \; = (A^4)^* \; \FubesXsb_P =\;  (A^4)^* \FubesXsc_P \; = - \FubesXs_P.
\end{align}
All other fubes are nonzero for both spin structures.
Hence, a complete basis for fubes for the anti-peridioc sector is given by
\begin{align}
\FubeXXX_A \quad \FubesXs_A \quad \FubeXss_A \quad \FubessX_A    \quad  \FubeXsds_A \quad \FubessdX_A
\end{align}
while a basis for the periodic sector is given by,
\begin{align}
\FubeXXX_P\quad \FubeXss_P \quad \FubessX_P   \quad \FubesdXs_P \quad  \FubeXsds_P \quad \FubessdX_P
\end{align}

The tensor product in the fube algebra is given by stacking fubes and simplifying the resulting composite fube using local relations.  
For example, in the periodic sector we have
\begin{align}
\FubesdXs_P \; \times \; \FubesdXs_P \; = \; \RDotTwoa_P \; = \; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(\RDotTwob_P + \RDotTwoc_P \right) = 2 \; \FubeXXX_P
\end{align}

Note that when we annihilate fermions into the vacuum to derive relations like this, we have to be careful about the order in which we do it, which is why we can never create two fermions side-by-side at the same time slice. For example, if we create fermion 1 above fermion 2 in a diagram, we must annihilate them along a $\Sigma$ string where fermion 1 is above fermion 2.
Also, note that since the spin structures on two fubes being fused must agree on the boundary at which they are being fused, periodic fubes only admit nonzero tensor products with periodic fubes, and similarly for anti-periodic fubes.

Relations like the ones above allow us to find the primitive central idempotents of the fube algebra, which carry the same information as the simple modules of the fube algebra, which in turn correspond to the vector spaces left invariant under the action of fube fusion\footnote{also known as {\it fubing}}, which we finally identify as quasiparticles. 

%The primitive central idempotents of an algebra $\mathcal{A}$ are given by a set $\Pi_a \in \mathcal{A}$ that satisfy: $\Pi_a \Pi_b = \delta_{ab} \Pi_a$ and $\Pi_a Q = Q \Pi_a$ for all $Q \in \mathcal{A}$, and each $\Pi_a$ cannot be decomposed as a sum of orthogonal idempotents. \ethan{Should we remove or relocate this paragraph?}

%\remove{Just realized we should probably have "odd" identity tubes, probbaly only in the periodic sector. They come from the tube in the parent theory which has a single fermion line. This in the target theory has $\psi$'s at the boundaries. We should then be able to cut it in half and the resulting tubes should still be elements of the tube algebra.}

\subsubsection{Kitaev wire}
\dave{This is actually really simple and super cool.}
\dave{Will need to find better notation for normal ordering and stuff.}
Here we propose a simple application of the above diagrammatic calculus. 
We will re-write the Kitaev-Majorana chain using this basis. 
The idea is to write down the natural anyon spin chain with this calculus and realize that it's exactly the Kitaev-Majorana chain. 
This elucidates the connection between Majorana zero modes and Ising anyons. 

The local ``on site" Hilbert space is spanned by two basis vectors
\begin{align}
    \CupSigma \qquad \text{and} \qquad \CupSigmadot
\end{align}
the first has even fermion parity, while the second has odd fermion parity.
The only terms one can contruct a Hamiltonian out of are
\begin{align}
\Id \qquad \text{and} \qquad \TwoLinedotdot
\end{align}
the first is the identity line, while the second is nontrivial and should be identified with $i \gamma_1 \gamma_2$, a Majorana bi-linear.
To see this, we can just check the action of the Hamiltonian on the basis vectors. 
\begin{align}
\TwoLinedotdot\; \times \; \CupSigma \; =\;  \CupSigma \quad \text{and} \quad \TwoLinedotdot\; \times \; \CupSigmadot \; =\;   - \; \CupSigmadot
\end{align}
\dave{Need to define ordering on vertices properly. I've been doing it by labeling the states first, then the operators have a natural ordering on them and I just begin counting from the last fermion on the state.}
For an $N$-site chain we have the basis of states,
\begin{align}
&\CupSigma \; \CupSigma \; \CupSigma \cdots \CupSigma\\
&\CupSigmadot \; \CupSigma \; \CupSigma \cdots \CupSigma\\
&\CupSigma \; \CupSigmadot \; \CupSigma \cdots \CupSigma\\
&\CupSigma \; \CupSigma \; \CupSigmadot \cdots \CupSigma\\
&\CupSigma \; \CupSigma \; \CupSigma \cdots \CupSigmadot\\
&\CupSigmadot \; \CupSigmadot \; \CupSigma \cdots \CupSigma
\end{align}
etcetera. Where there are $N$ cups appearing, and the fermion dots are ordered from right to left, and any number of them can appear.
If a state has an odd number of dots it has odd fermion parity, while an even number of dots has even fermion parity.
The Hamiltonian has two types of terms. One term mixes the states on site -- or within a single cup, while the other mixes nearest neighbour cups.
We will denote the onsite Hamiltonian terms by $H_{2j}$ and the the term which couples the nearest neighbour cups by $H_{2j+1}$.
Then the Hamiltonian takes on the form,
\begin{align}
H = - \sum_j\; t_j \; \;  \TwoLinedotdot_{\text{site $j$}}
\end{align}
Now in the completely staggered limit it's easy to see what the ground states are,
\begin{align}
\StaggaredGSEven \; \cdots \; \StaggaredGSEvenR  
\qquad \text{and} \qquad 
\StaggaredGSOdd \; \cdots  \; \StaggaredGSEvenR
\end{align}
The first differing from the second by fermion parity.
Excitations are built by putting dots on the intermediate cups. 
A nice feature of the diagrammatic notation is that the ``delocalization" of femrion number is made manifest.
For example the fermion odd state does not have a femrion localized at either end, rather its free to slide from one end to the other.
When transforming back to the original basis, one sees that the state is actually an even superposition of all possible placements of an even number of fermions, similarly for the odd state.

\subsection{Quasiparticle excitations}

To figure out the quasiparticle spectrum, we, as stated earlier, need to find the irreducible representations (or simple modules) of the tube algebra. Since the tube algebra splits into a direct sum of tubes with different spin structures, its simple modules will split in a similar way. First, we turn to an analysis of tubes with anti-periodic boundary counditions. 

\subsubsection{Anti-periodic sector}

Let us first examine the subalgebra of tubes with no charge: that is, cylinders with empty boundary conditions on both their top and bottom. Writing this subalgebra as $\tube_0^A$, we see that it is generated by two even tubes:
\be \tube_0^A = \left\langle\; \FubeXXX,\; \FubesXs\;\right\rangle.\ee
The odd tube with a horizontal $\beta$ line and a single fermion is zero, since taking the fermion once around the cylinder shows that it is equal to minus itself. 
Since $\tube_0^A$ has two even generators, as an algebra it must be isomorphic to $\cc^{2|0}$. The idempotents associated with this sector are easy to compute: $\cc^{2|0}$ has two simple modules and so we get two quasiparticles, which we label by $m_\unit$ and $m_\psi$. Explicitly, they are 
\be m_\unit = \frac{1}{2}\left( \FubeXXX_A +\;\; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\FubesXs_A\right),\qquad m_\psi = \frac{1}{2} \left( \FubeXXX_A -\;\; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \FubesXs_A\right).\ee
One can check that these idempotents are central, primitive, and orthogonal, and as such are associated with a pair of zero-charge quasiparticles. 

Now we turn to the subalgebra $\tube^A_\beta$ of charged tubes: those whose top and bottom boundary conditions consist of a single marked point. There are two non-zero even tubes and two non-zero odd tubes:
\be \tube^A_\beta = \left\langle\; \FubeXss,\;\FubeXsds,\; \FubessX,\; \FubessdX\right\rangle,\ee
meaning that as an algebra, $\tube^A_\beta \cong \cc^{2|2}$. $\cc^{2|2}$ is isomorphic to both $\cl_2$ and $\cl_1\oplus \cl_1$, and so we know that this sector will contribute either one (if $\cl_2$) or two (if $\cl_1^{\oplus 2}$) quasiparticle excitations. 

In order to identify the idempotents of this subalgebra, we need to write down the multiplication rules. By using the local relations in the $C_2$ theory we can work out the multiplication table as follows, where $A\tp B$ means ``stack $A$ on top of $B$'', and where we always take fermions in the $A$ tube to have a larger normal order than fermions in the $B$ tube:
\be
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{3}
\begin{tabular}{c | c c c c r}
$\times$ in $\tube^A_{\beta} $          & $\FubeXss $ & $\FubeXsds $ & $\FubessX $&$ \FubessdX$  \\
\hline
$\FubeXss$ & $\FubeXss$ & $\ \FubeXsds$  & $\FubessX$ & $\FubessdX$  \\

$\FubeXsds$           & $\FubeXsds $& $i\ \FubeXss$ & $\FubessdX $& $i\ \FubessX  $\\

$\FubessX$          & $\FubessX $&$ -\ \FubessdX  $&$ e^{-i\pi/4}\ \FubeXss $&$ -e^{-i\pi/4}\ \FubeXsds $\\

$\FubessdX    $&$ \FubessdX $&$ -i\ \FubessX $&$ e^{-i\pi/4}\ \FubeXsds $&$ -e^{i\pi/4}\ \FubeXss$   \\
\end{tabular}
\ee
Note that in the above table, we've taken $A^4 = i$ for concreteness. Since the multiplication table is non-abelian, this algebra must be $\cl_2$, as $\cl_1\oplus\cl_1$ is abelian. 
In order to show that this is indeed the multiplication table of $\cl_2$, we perform the following re-scaling:
\be \FubeXsds \mapsto e^{-\pi i/4} \FubeXsds,
\qquad \FubessX \mapsto e^{5\pi i/8} \FubessX,\qquad \FubessdX \mapsto e^{3\pi i/8} \FubessdX.\ee
With this, the re-scaled multiplication table becomes 
\be
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{3}
\begin{tabular}{c | c c c c r}
$\times$ in $\tube^A_{\beta} $          & $\FubeXss $ & $\FubeXsds $ & $\FubessX $&$ \FubessdX$  \\
\hline
$\FubeXss$ & $\FubeXss$ & $\FubeXsds$  & $\FubessX$ & $\FubessdX$  \\
$\FubeXsds$           & $\FubeXsds $& $\FubeXss$ & $\FubessdX $& $\FubessX  $\\
$\FubessX$          & $\FubessX $&$ -\FubessdX  $&$ -\FubeXss $&$ \FubeXsds $\\
$\FubessdX    $&$ \FubessdX $&$ -\FubessX $&$ -\FubeXsds $&$ \FubeXss$   \\
\end{tabular}
\ee
Recall that $\cl_2$ has two even generators $1$ and $\gamma_1\gamma_2$, and two anticommuting odd generators $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ that square to $1$. We see that if we make the identifications
\be 1 =\FubeXss,\quad \gamma_1 =  \FubeXsds,\quad \gamma_2 = \FubessdX,\quad i\gamma_1\gamma_2 =  \FubessX,\ee
we have the required anticommutation relations $\{\gamma_1,\gamma_2\} = 0$, as well as the identities $\gamma_1^2 = \gamma_2^2 = 1$, and so indeed, $\tube^A_\beta \cong \cl_2$. 
%Since we have $c^\dagger c = i\gamma_1\gamma_2$ if $c = (\gamma_1 + i\gamma_2)/\sqrt{2}$, we have the intriguing relation 
%\be c^\dagger c = \FubessX.\ee
%That is, we see that the number operator is equal to the tube that implements the twist. This actually makes sense: each fermion on an anti-periodic tube gives a factor of $-1$ when twisted, and so twisting tubes gives a way of computing the (physical) fermion parity of the tube. 

We now turn to the task of identifying the quasiparticles (simple modules) of this algebra. 
Because of the Morita equivalence between $\cl_2$ and $\cc$, $\cl_2$ and $\cc$ must have the same simple modules (idempotents), and so the subalgebra $\tube^A_\beta$ must correspond to only one type of quasiparticle.

To see this directly, we note that since $\cl_2 \cong \End(\cc^{1|1})$, its simple modules (quasiparticles) can each be identified with the space $\cc^{1|1}$. It's easy to check that there are two different simple modules which we write as $m^{\pm}$, corresponding to the representations of $\cl_2$ $\rho^\pm : \cl_2 \ra \Aut(\cc^{1|1})$ given by $\rho^\pm(1) = \sigma^0,\rho^\pm(\gamma_1) = \sigma^x,$ and $\rho^\pm(\gamma_2) = \pm i\sigma^y$, where the $\gamma_i$ maintain their earlier identifications. This means that the two quasiparticle types $m^\pm$ associated with the two representations differ in the sign of the representation matrix of $\gamma_2$, meaning that we can write them as
\be m_\sigma^\pm = \frac{1}{2} \left(\FubeXss_A \pm e^{i\pi/8}\ \FubessX_A\right),\ee
since the second tube in the above expression is oddly isomorphic to $\gamma_2$. Note that we're letting each fube in the above expression represent its isomorphism class, which is why we haven't added any fubes in $\fld(C)^1$ with odd fermion parity to the expression for $m_\sigma^\pm$ (as they are isomorphic to the even-parity fubes in the expression for $m^\pm$) . 

This looks to give us two quasiparticles, which is a contradiction. The resolution to this is that the two simple modules $m^\pm$ are actually {\it oddly isomorphic} to one another, by virtue of the anti-periodic spin structures they possess. Creating a fermion on the top of the $\gamma_2$ tube (which corresponds to the isomorphism given by left multiplication by $\gamma_1$), dragging it around the $\gamma_2$ tube to the bottom, and then annihilating it (through the isomorphism given by right multiplication by $\gamma_1$) acts on the matrix representations as  $\rho^\pm(\gamma_2) \mapsto \rho^\mp(\gamma_2)$, and thus establishes an isomorphism $m^+\cong m^-$. Since only isomorphism classes of quasiparticles are physical, we can therefore identify the two modules $m_\sigma^\pm$ with a single quasiparticle. In what follows, we will choose $m_\sigma^+$ as the representative for the isomorphism class. 

We will examine the fusion rules and braiding properties of the three quasiparticles identified so far later. For now, we repeat our quasiparticle identification procedure for quasiparticles in the vortex sector, which possess spin structures with periodic boundary conditions around the cylinder. 

\subsubsection{Periodic (vortex) sector}

$\cl_1$ has only one simple module, namely $\cc^{1|1}$ with the matrix representation $\rho(1) = \sigma^0,\rho(\gamma)=\sigma^x$, and so will support only one quasiparticle

The explicit presentation for the $\cl_1$ quasiparticle is a bit more subtle. Since $\fld^P(C)$ is a graded superspace, we are prevented from adding field configurations with different fermion parity, and thus cannot form superpositions of the tubes in $\fube^P_0$. However, we note that in $\cl_1$, $1$ and $\gamma$ are isomorphic through multiplication by $\gamma$, which establishes an (odd) isomorphism between the two basis vectors in $\fube^P_0$. Since only isomorphism classes of field configurations are physical, we can identify the two fubes with one another, which form an orbit under multiplication by $\gamma$. For definiteness we will choose to represent this isomorphism class by the even-parity sector, and so we write the $\cl_1$ quasiparticle as (really? or just say idempotents have to be even?)
\be q_\sigma = \FubeXXX_P.\ee








Now for the periodic spin structure, corresponding to the subalgebra $\fube_\Sigma^P$. The multiplication table for $\fube_\Sigma^P$ is the same as the one for the $\fube_\Sigma^A$, modulo a few minus signs and conjugations. Explicitly, we obtain
\be
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{3}
\begin{tabular}{c | c c c c r}
$\tp$ in $\fube^P_{\Sigma} $          & $\FubeXss $ & $\FubeXsds $ & $\FubessX $&$ \FubessdX$  \\
\hline

$\FubeXss$ & $\FubeXss$ & $ \FubeXsds$  & $\FubessX$ & $\FubessdX$  \\

$\FubeXsds$           & $\FubeXsds $& $i\ \FubeXss$ & $\FubessdX $& $i\ \FubessX  $\\

$\FubessX$          & $\FubessX $&$ \ \FubessdX  $&$ e^{i\pi/4}\ \FubeXss $&$ e^{i\pi/4}\ \FubeXsds $\\

$\FubessdX    $&$ \FubessdX $&$ i\ \FubessX $&$ e^{i\pi/4}\ \FubeXsds $&$ e^{i3\pi/4}\ \FubeXss$   \\
\end{tabular}
\ee

As in the anti-periodic, we can do a re-scaling of the tubes to make the underlying algebraic structure more transparent. The most convenient re-scaling is 
\be \FubeXsds \mapsto e^{-\pi i/4} \FubeXsds,
\qquad \FubessX \mapsto e^{\pi i/8} \FubessX,\qquad \FubessdX \mapsto e^{-\pi i/8} \FubessdX.\ee
With this choice of re-scaling, the re-scaled multiplication table for $\fube_\Sigma^P$ is the same as re-scaled one for $\fube_\Sigma^A$, expect there are no minus signs, meaning that $\fube_\Sigma^P$ is commutative. Since we argued earlier that the only choices for $\fube_\Sigma^{A/P}$ were $\cl_1\oplus\cl_1$ or $\cl_2$, commutativity implies that we can set $\fube_\Sigma^P \cong \cl_1\oplus\cl_1$. To check this we need to do a little manipulation, since the multiplication table for $\fube_\Sigma^P$ doesn't look like a direct sum of two $\cl_1$ multiplication tables at first glance. To fix notation, we will write the two odd generators in $\cl_1\oplus\cl_1$ as $\gamma^+$ and $\gamma^-$, and the even generators as $1^+, 1^-$. If we define these generators in terms of the fubes by (keeping the phases explicit)
\be \unit^\pm = \frac{1}{2}\left(\FubeXss \pm e^{-i\pi/8}\FubessX\right),\qquad   \gamma^\pm = \frac{e^{-i\pi/4}}{2}\left(\FubeXsds \pm e^{-i\pi/8}\FubessdX\right)\ee
and then re-write the multiplication table for $\fube_\Sigma^P$, we see that we indeed get a $\langle \unit^+ ,\gamma^+\rangle \oplus \langle \unit^- \oplus \gamma^-\rangle =\cl_1\oplus\cl_1$ structure with $(\gamma^\pm)^2 = \unit^\pm$. Thus, there are two $\cl_1$-type quasiparticles corresponding to the $\fube_\Sigma^P$ subalgebra. Again, since only isomorphism classes of fubes are physical, we can write the two $\cl_1$-type quasiparticles in terms of even-parity fubes only:
\be q_\unit = \unit^+,\qquad q_\psi = \unit^-.\ee

\subsection{Obtaining the quasiparticle fusion rules}

With all idempotents at hand we are in a place to compute the fusion rules. The process is the same as discussed in Section \ref{FindingFusionRules}.
We take three idempotents and ask if there exists a linear combination of pants that will take two of the idempotents to the third. The number of linearly independant maps gives the fusion multiplicity.
Computationally it is easier to search for pairs of pants that are invariant under application of each idempotent. 
For example, suppose we wanted to find the fusion rule for $q_\sigma \otimes m_1$.
We first note that the spin structure boundary conditions require that they fuse to a vortex (a fube with a periodic spin structure). Furthurmore, since both $m_1$ and $q_\sigma$ have flux and no charge, we know that the pants cannot have any charge lines. Since there is only one resulting fube that has no charge lines and periodic  boundary conditions, namely $q_\sigma$, we know that the pair of pants desribing the fusion $q_\sigma \otimes m_1$ is the supervector space with even generator
\begin{align}
\fld_{q_\sigma\tp m_1}^{q_\sigma}(Y; \text{even}) = \left\langle \PantsPAP \; +\;  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \PantsPAsP \right \rangle
\end{align}
and odd generator
\begin{align}
\fld_{q_\sigma\tp m_1}^{q_\sigma}(Y;  \text{odd}) = \left\langle \PantsPsdAP \; +\;  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \PantsPsdAsP \right \rangle
\end{align}
\dave{add note about moving dot from top leg to bottom.}
and the fusion rule is $q_\sigma \otimes m_1 = q_\sigma$.
Similarly the supervector space $\fld_{q_\sigma \tp m_\psi}(Y)$ has one even generator
\begin{align}
\fld_{q_\sigma\tp m_\psi}(Y) = \left\langle \PantsPAP \; - \; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \PantsPAsP \right \rangle
\end{align}
and the analgous odd generator
and therefore $q_\sigma \tp m_\psi = q_\sigma$.
\dave{Fix to include odd generators as well in rest of section.}
A more nontrivial example is to consider the tensor product of two $q_\sigma$ idempotents.
This again has no charge, but the resulting tube can have either flux, 
\begin{align}
\fld_{q_\sigma\tp q_\sigma}(Y) &= \left\langle \PantsPPA \; +\;  \PantsPPAs \right \rangle\\
&= \left\langle \PantsPPA  + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \PantsPPAs \right \rangle \bigoplus \left\langle \PantsPPA  - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \PantsPPAs \right \rangle
\end{align}
where in the second line we have decomposed the first line into pants that are invariant under application of $m_1$ and $m_\psi$. 
This demonstrates the fusion rule $q_\sigma \tp q_\sigma = m_1 \oplus m_\psi$. 
Slightly more non-trivial fusion rules follows from $m_\sigma^{\pm} \tp m_\psi$ and $m_\sigma^{\pm} \tp m_\psi$. 
The idempotent $m_\psi$ is purely flux, and so the pants can only have pure flux degrees of freedom on the leg matching the $m_\psi$ idempotent. $m_\sigma^{\pm}$ also has charge. 
Hence the idempotent resulting from from fusion will also have charge and again have anti periodic boundary conditions.
One finds that the $m_\sigma$ idempotent can be slipped up the pair of pants with the expense of introducing a $\sigma$ line around the other leg,
\begin{align}
\PantsAstAAs  = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \;  \PantsAsAshAsvt
\end{align}
Now one can check that $m_\psi$ is an eigenstate of the closed sigma loop with eigenvalue $-\sqrt{2}$ and $m_1$ is an eigenstate with eigenvalue $+\sqrt{2}$. Hence one finds that $m_\sigma^{\pm} \tp m_\psi  = m_\sigma^{\mp} \cong m_\sigma^\pm$ and $m_\sigma^{\pm} \tp m_1 = m_\sigma^{\pm}$. 
Hence we can write, for example,
\begin{align}
\fld_{m_\sigma^{\pm} \tp m_\psi}^{m_\sigma^{\mp}}(Y) = \left\langle \PantsAsAAs -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\PantsAsAshAs \pm \PantsAstAAs  \mp \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \PantsAstAshAs   \right \rangle
\end{align}
Since the $m_\sigma^{+}$ is isomorphic to to $m_\sigma^-$ we can always choose to work with either $m_\sigma^+$ or $m_\sigma^-$. In this case we can write,
\begin{align}
\fld_{m_\sigma^{+} \tp m_\psi}^{m_\sigma^{+}}({}^AY_A^A, \text{odd}) = \left\langle \PantssvXsvd -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\Pantssvtshsvd + \PantssvtXsvd  - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \Pantssvshsvd   \right \rangle 
\end{align}

The trickiest is $m_\sigma^\pm \tp m_{\sigma}^\pm$. For these we have, 
\begin{align}
\text{\dave{some pants}} &=      \Pantssvtsvtsh

\end{align}
and the odd ones are given by putting a single dot on the upper left leg.

\section{Braiding data}

 
\subsection{$R$-matrices}
In this subsection we provide a table of the $R$ symbols in the theory. First, we need to set some conventions on our fusion spaces. We will work on the three-punctured sphere rather than drawing out pairs of pants, as it is much easier to perform calculations using the three-punctured sphere picture. 

We will write a generic even fusion space, which is an even vector in the fusion space $\fld^{a,b}_c$, as 
\be \label{pants_braiding_basis} \includegraphics{pants_braiding_basis.pdf},\ee
where $a,b,c\in \mcz(C_2)$ and $u,v,w\in \zt$ are variables indicating whether or not a $\beta$ line is present on the given link. The idempotent labels represent a collection of pictures, one for each tube in their definition. For example, 
\be \includegraphics{msig_def.pdf} \ee

We will calculate the braiding in the fusion space $\fld^{a,b}_c$ by moving the $a$ and $b$ punctures around one other and re-expressing the result in terms of the basis vectors in $\fld^{b,a}_c$. When braiding $q$-type particles, we enforce their periodic boundary conditions graphically by introducing branch cuts ending on each $q$-type puncture, with the rule that dots sliding past a branch cut pick up a phase of $-1$. For concreteness, we will draw our branch cuts to always meet near the center of the three punctures. For example, to calculate $R^{q_\psi q_{1/\psi}}_{m_{\psi/1}}$, we write
\be \includegraphics{qpsiq1psi_braiding} \ee
where the dashed blue lines are the branch cuts, and we have taken advantage of our knowledge of the eigenvalue of $q_\psi$ under the twisted tube (i.e. the spin of $q_\psi$). 

We define odd vectors in $\fld^{a,b}_c$ by placing dots on the top left leg of the pants, on the leg marked $u$ in \eqref{pants_braiding_basis}. If this is impossible (e.g. if the top left leg is an $m_\psi$ idempotent), we put the dot on the top right leg of the pants, marked $v$ in \eqref{pants_braiding_basis}. For example, we can calculate the $R$-symbol $R^{m_\psi m_\sigma^+}_{m_\sigma^+} = -1$ by
\be \includegraphics{mpsimsig_braiding.pdf}.\ee
A slightly more complicated example is the odd fusion channel in $R^{q_\psi q_{1/\psi}}_{m_{\psi/1}}$:
\be \includegraphics{qpsiq1psidot_braiding.pdf} \ee
Note that we have assumed we can ``pivot'' branch cuts around the punctures on which they are located, provided that we pick up a factor of $-1$ each time the branch cut crosses a fermion. 

We have to remember to always move the dots back to the left side of the pants after the braid takes place, if possible. As an example, we can calculate the braiding of the odd fusion channel in $R^{q_\sigma q_{1/\psi}}_{m_\sigma^+}$:
\be \includegraphics{qsigq1psidot_braiding.pdf} \ee


Hopefully these examples convey the general idea of how to work out the full table of $R$-symbols, which we present below.

\\ \ \\
For convenience, we have defined 
\be \zeta := e^{-i\pi/8} = \theta_{m_\sigma^+}.\ee
If we switched the choice for $A^4$ (e.g. from $i$ to $-i$), we could obtain the switched $R$-symbols by sending $\zeta \mapsto \zeta^*$. 

\subsection{Twists}

There are three ways to compute the twist: by statistics (braiding two identical idempotents around one another), by spin (applying Dehn twists on the idempotents), and by modular transformations (by performing Dehn twists on the torus). 

We'll start by computing the twists by statistics, namely by tracing out the $R$ symbols. 
First for the $m$ sector. 
If we use the normal trace, we obtain 
\be \theta_{m_\unit} = 1,\ \theta_{m_\psi} = 1,\ \theta_{m^\pm_\sigma} = \pm e^{-i\pi/8}.\ee
If we use the supertrace instead, we get 
\be \theta_{m_\unit} = 1,\ \theta_{m_\psi} = 1,\ \theta_{m^\pm_\sigma} = \pm e^{3i\pi/8}.\ee
Now for the $q$ sector. If we use the trace, we get 
\be \theta_{q_\unit} = e^{i\pi/8},\ \theta_{q_\psi} = -e^{i\pi/8},\ \theta_{q_\sigma} = 1,\ee
while if we use the supertrace, we get 
\be \theta_{q_\unit} = e^{-3i\pi/8},\ \theta_{q_\psi} = -e^{-3i\pi/8},\ \theta_{q_\sigma} = 1.\ee

Now we will compute the spins of the idempotents by Dehn-twisting each of their tubes. This can be done by looking at the tube algebra multiplication tables for each of the periodic and anti-periodic sectors. 
For the anti-periodic sector, we obtain 
\be \theta_{m_\unit} = 1,\ \theta_{m_\psi} = 1,\ \theta_{m^\pm_\sigma} = \pm e^{-i\pi/8}.\ee
For the periodic (vortex) sector, we obtain 
\be \theta_{q_\unit} = e^{i\pi/8},\ \theta_{q_\psi} = -e^{i\pi/8},\ \theta_{q_\sigma} = 1.\ee
Note that the $T$-matrix in the vortex sector decomposes as 
\be T_P = T_{p+ip} \tp T_{\text{Ising}^{\nu = -1}},\ee
agreeing with previous results which computed the modular transformations on the periodic-periodic torus, and hinted at the existence of a secret $p+ip$ superconductor in the vortex sector. Additionally, notice that if we want to have spin-statistics hold, we need to {\it trace} out the $R$-symbols, not supertrace them.

In the expressions above, the twists of every non-vortex $m$-type particle are ambiguous up to a factor of $\pm1$, corresponding to an ambiguity in the parity of physical fermions (boxes) attached to the tubes at the time of twisting. In this picture, the $q$-type particles have no such ambiguity, since moving an extra physical fermion around a periodic tube incurs no $-1$ sign as a result.  
If we believe that the philosophy behind the expression for chiral central charge familiar from the bosonic case goes through unchanged in the superfusion case, we should have $c_-=0$ for this theory, since we can realize this phase in a lattice model. This is sort of trivially true for the non-vortex sector, since the twists being only defined up to $\pm1$ mean that the sum over twists ``averages out'' and becomes zero. The constraint on $c_-=0$ is a nontrivial constraint for the vortex sector though, since the twists there are fully determined. Of course, by looking at the list of twists, we see that the vortex sector is indeed non-chiral. Physically, there are hints that the $c_-=-1/2$ of the Ising theory (which would be $c_- = 1/2$ if we chose $A^4=-i$) is cancelled by the $c_-=1/2$ of a background $p+ip$ superconductor that came along with the fermions we added to equip the theory with a spin structure. 

\subsection{Topological $S$-matrix}
\subsubsection{From braiding}

Having obtained the $R$ symbols, we can now go ahead and calculate the $S$-matrix. To do this, we will use the following quantum dimensions: 
\be d_{m_1} = d_{m_\psi} = 1,\quad d_{m_\sigma^+} = d_{q_1} = d_{q_\psi} = \sqrt{2},\quad d_{q_\sigma} = 2,\ee
which gives $\mcd = \sqrt{12}$.

There are several ways to calculate $S$. For all of them, we should keep in mind that although there are some $\pm1$ ambiguities in $T$, such ambiguities should not be present in $S$, since fermions have trivial double-braiding with one another. That is, mapping $m_a \mapsto fm_a$ where $a\in \{\unit,\psi,\sigma\}$ and $f$ is a physical fermion should not affect the answer we get for the $S$-matrix. In what follows we will calculate the $S$-matrix in several different ways, and then use a handful of different arguments to figure out what each calculation means. 

First, we can calculate $S$ by tracing out the $R$-symbols, using 
\be S_{ab} = \frac{1}{\mcd}\sum_{c}d_c{\rm Tr}[R^{ab}_cR^{ba}_c],\ee
where ${\rm Tr}$ is the trace, not the supertrace. This gives 
\be 
 S^{Tr} = \frac{1}{\mcd} \begin{pmatrix} 
1&\sqrt{2}&1&2\sqrt{2}&4&2\sqrt{2} \\
 \sqrt{2}&0&-\sqrt{2}&4&0&-4 \\ 
 1&-\sqrt{2}&1&-2\sqrt{2}&4&-2\sqrt{2} \\ 
 2\sqrt{2}&4& -2\sqrt{2}&0&0&0 \\ 
 4&0&4&0&0&0 \\ 
  2\sqrt{2}&-4&- 2\sqrt{2}&0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \ee
 which is modular. The block of zeros in the bottom right isn't a disaster---indeed, we might expect something like this for physical reasons, since braiding a $q$-type particle through a $q$-type loop could potentially change the $q$-loop's fermion parity, preventing it from fusing to the vacuum and evaluating to a tadpole diagram (this is the same reason that $S_{\sigma\sigma} = 0$ in the regular Ising theory). After we discuss the difference between the trace and the supertrace, we'll have a slightly more intelligent way of arguing that the zeros here make sense (note that computing $qq$ block of $S$ as above is different than computing the modular $S$-matrix on the $(P,P)$ torus, which we definitely expect to be nonzero). 
 

Instead of tracing the $R$ matrices, we can appeal to a formula relating the $S$ matrix to the topological twists. In bosonic theories, we have 
\be \label{stwist_bosonic} S_{ab} = \frac{1}{\mcd} \sum_c d_c N^{ab}_c \frac{\theta_c}{\theta_a\theta_b}.\ee
This needs to be modified in the superfusion case. By looking at the derivation of \eqref{stwist_bosonic}, we see that it involves passing vectors in the fusion space $\fld^{a,b}_c$ under a $c$ tube, and then over both an $a$ tube and over a $b$ tube. When the braiding process is embedded in $S^3$, the branch cuts become branch sheets, and so passing an odd vector in $\fld^{a,b}_c$ under a $q$-type idempotent gives a phase factor of $-1$ (we could also choose this to be obtained when passing over a $q$-type idempotent). Additionally, vectors in $\fld^{a,b}_c$ are transported in a loop during the derivation of \eqref{stwist_bosonic}, which contributes a sign of $-1$ if the vector is odd. We need to modify the previous relation to take into account both these effects, and so the correct expression for $S^{Tr}$ in the fermionic setting is 
\be S^{Tr}_{ab} = \frac{1}{\mcd} \sum_c \sum_{v \in \fld^{a,b}_c} d_c (-1)^{|v| (|c|+1)}   \frac{\theta_c}{\theta_a\theta_b},\ee
where $|v| \in \{0,1\}$ is the parity of the vector $v$ and $|c| = 1$ $(|c|=0)$ if $c$ is $q$-type ($m$-type). Note that the factor of $(-1)^{|v||c|}$ will only contribute for braids between $m$-type and $q$-type particles. Also, note that this formula reproduces $S^{Tr}$, not $S^{sTr}$. If we wanted to get the supertrace $S$-matrix, we'd have to weight each summand by a further $(-1)^{|v|}$:
\be S^{sTr}_{ab} = \frac{1}{\mcd} \sum_c \sum_{v \in \fld^{a,b}_c} d_c (-1)^{|v| |c|}   \frac{\theta_c}{\theta_a\theta_b}.\ee

There is a slight technicality here, since our formula for $S$ depends on our choice of twists for the $m$-type particles, even though we argued that the $S$ matrix should not suffer from the $\pm$ ambiguities that $T$ possesses. This means that the expression must be further modified so as to be invariant under fusing physical fermions onto $m$-type particles. This is done by writing 
\be S^{Tr}_{ab} = \frac{1}{\mcd} \sum_c \sum_{v \in \fld^{a,b}_c} d_c (-1)^{|v| (|c| + 1) + f(a,b,c)}   \frac{\theta_c}{\theta_a\theta_b},\ee
where $f(a,b,c)$ measures the number of {\it physical} fermions attached to any $m$-type particles in $a$, $b$ and $c$. For example, if we were to choose $\theta_{m_\unit} = 1, \theta_{m_\psi} = -1,\theta_{m^+_\sigma} = e^{-i\pi/8}$ (e.g, if we chose $\psi$ to come with a single physical fermion attached to it), we would have 
\be {f(a,b,c)} = \delta_{a,m_\psi} + \delta_{b,m_\psi} + \delta_{c,m_\psi}.\ee
The simplest convention is probably to take $m_\unit$ and $m_\psi$ to be bosonic and to use $m_\sigma^+$ as our representative for the $m_\sigma$ isomorphism class, which we have been doing throughout and will continue to do. However, we might also want to take $m_\psi$ to be fermionic, to jive with the Ising theory better. In any case, $S$ is at least independent of this choice. 

\subsubsection{Ground states on tori}

By drawing pictures, it's easy to see that spin structures uniquely determine the fermion parity of any given string-net picture drawn on the torus. We would then expect that each of the four tori would carry four degenerate ground states, since $|H_1(T^2)|=4$. However, for each spin structure one of these states will turn out to not lie in the ground state manifold, meaning that there will only be three degenerate ground states for each choice of spin structure. 

We now write down the degenerate ground states for each spin structure on the torus. For the $(A,A)$ sector, we have the three states 
\be GS_{(A,A)} = \FubeXXX,\ \FubeXss,\ \FubesXs.\ee
For periodic boundary conditions around the longitudinal cycle (the shorter cycle, horizontal in our pictures), we have 
\be GS_{(P,A)} = \FubeXXX,\ \FubeXss,\ \FubessX.\ee
For periodic boundary conditions around the meridional cycle (the big cycle, vertical in our pictures), we have 
\be GS_{(A,P)} = \FubeXXX,\ \FubesXs,\ \FubessX,\ee
and for periodic boundary conditions around both cycles, we get 
\be GS_{(P,P)} = \FubesdXs,\ \FubeXsds,\ \FubessdX.\ee 
Notice that all of the tubes on the $(P,P)$ torus are odd. This is more evidence for the presence of a background $p+ip$ superconductor, since a $p+ip$ superconductor always has odd fermion parity when placed on a $(P,P)$ torus. 

%Also note that on every torus, there is one additional non-zero picture which lies at higher energy, which can be obtained by drawing the configuration of $\Sigma$ lines not present in the given collection of three pictures, adding on a dot, and creating a massive fermionic excitation somewhere in the background\dave{Not higher energy, but the state is equal to zero.}. For the $(P,P)$ torus, this high-energy state is the empty picture with a massive fermionic excitation (will elaborate later). 

Having three ground states for each spin structure means that we have 12 ground states across all spin structures. How can we relate this to the fact that $|\mcz(C_2)| = 6$? The idea is that the number of ground states is captured by tracing the identity functor on $\mcz(C_2)$, where the identity functor is
\be {\rm id} = \bigoplus_{a\in\mcz(C_2)} a,\ee
since the direct sum of a complete collection of primitive idempotents maps everything to itself. When we say ``trace out the identity functor'', we mean crossing the tubes in id with an $S^1$ so that they form a collection of tori, embedding them in $S^3$, and evaluating the resulting configuration by filling in the complement of the tubes with a TV state-sum with fixed boundary conditions. Filling in the complement of the tubes with a TV state-sum can only be done if we choose a spin structure on the timelike $S^1$ that can be smoothly extended to a spin structure on a disk, which means that we must choose anti-periodic boundary conditions for the timelike $S^1$. Therefore, only half of the ground states on the collection of tori will come from tracing out id. The rest (on tori with periodic boundary conditions around the meridional cycle) come from tracing out some sort of twisted id functor, which has a $\pi$ flux inserted through the cycle of the $S^1$. 

These arguments make the case for using anti-periodic boundary conditions on the timelike $S^1$ when calculating the twists and braids of the idempotents through the $R$-symbols. All that's left is to decide whether this means we should use the trace or supertrace. At this moment in time, all signs seem to point to the trace being associated with antiperiodic boundary conditions. This is for two reasons. First, we can observe that the using the supertrace to calculate the $S$ matrix in the $qq$ braiding sector gives us something (almost) proportional to $\zeta^2$ (the fact that $S_{q_\sigma q_\sigma}$ isn't may not be a problem), while using the trace gives us a $qq$ $S$-matrix of $0$. We know that we should have $S^4 = -1$ when acting on the ground states of a $(P,P)$ torus, which suggests that the supertrace is what we want to use to compute $S$ for the $(P,P)$ torus. Thus, the supertrace should be associated with periodic boundary conditions along the timelike $S^1$, leaving the trace to be associated with anti-periodic boundary conditions along the timelike $S^1$. 

Alternatively, we can imagine starting with a double braid between two odd fusion spaces, and then moving one of the fermions around the timelike $S^1$ so that both fermions are placed at the same fusion space. Doing so gives us two factors of $-1$ (since the $S^1$ has antiperiodic boundary conditions), and results in a diagram which gives the trace of two even vectors. This further suggests that the trace should be associated with anti-periodic boundary conditions around the timelike $S^1$. Recapitulating pictorially, this means that the trace is untwisted, and the supertrace is twisted by a spin structure vortex:
\be \includegraphics{tr_and_str.pdf} \ee

We are now in a position to give a more compelling argument for why the $qq$ braiding sector of $S^{Tr}$ is $0_{3\times 3}$. Since each $q$-type idempotent is associated with a torus with $(P,A)$ spin structure (periodic around the spatial $S^1$, anti-periodic around the timelike $S^1$), a double-braid between two $q$-type particles looks like: 
\be \includegraphics{linked_qtori.pdf}\ee
When we compute this partition function, we thicken the two tori so that their boundaries become glued with one another, forming a torus dividing the ambient $S^3$ into two solid tori. However, we see that the above choice of spin structures makes this gluing process impossible, since the spin structures on the two linked tori do not agree when one another when the tori are glued. More precisely, we see that the boundary conditions on the meridional cycle of one linked torus must match the longitudinal boundary conditions of the other in order for the gluing procedure to be well-defined, which is not the case in the above figure. This means that the partition function of a linking of two $q$-type idempotents must be zero, which explains the block of zeros in $S^{Tr}$.

\subsubsection{Modular transformations}

In this section, we'll switch to using $A$ in equations rather than just implicitly working with $A^4=i$. Since $d = -A^2 - A^{-2}$, in order to have $d=\sqrt{2}$ we will pick $A = ie^{i\pi/8}$. Also, to make the notation a bit more compact, we will define 
\be e := \FubeXXX,\quad h := \FubesXs,\quad v := \FubeXss,\quad t:= \FubessX,\ee
with the spin structures of the tubes left to be understood in context. As a reminder, we are using the label $(X,Y)$ to denote the spin structure on $T^2$ with boundary condition $X$ along the spatial $S^1$ and boundary condition $Y$ along the timelike $S^1$ (so that e.g. the $q$-type idempotents are associated with $(P,A)$). This is a bit backwards, depending on how you look at it---might change it later. 

\underline{$\mathbf{(P,P)}$:} First, we'll look at the $(P,P)$ torus, whose spin structure is preserved under both $S$ and $T$. The three vectors in the basis of ground states are $v_\bullet,h_\bullet,$ and $t_\bullet$,
where the $\bullet$s in labels mean that their associated tubes have odd fermion parity (the $h_\bullet$ tube has a $\beta$ string wrapping around its diameter). 
In the ground state basis $(v_\bullet,h_\bullet,t_\bullet)^T$, we see that 
\be S^{gs}_{PP} = \begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 & 0 \\ A^4 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & A^{-6} \end{pmatrix},\quad T^{gs}_{PP} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & A^{-6} \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\ee
One can check that $(ST)^3 = S^4= -\unit_{3\times3}$. Note that $S^{-1} = A^4 S$ (schematically, since the difference between the two is a $\pi$ rotation in framing), so the $S$ matrix is not self-dual as it is for bosonic theories. Also, as a sanity check we see that the eigenvalues of $T$ are $1,\pm A^{-3}$ (if $A^4=i$, then $A^{-3} = e^{i\pi/8}$).

To transform these matrices into the idempotent basis in which $T$ is diagonalized, we take 
\be S \mapsto V^{-1}SV,\ T\mapsto V^{-1}TV,\ee 
where in this case $V$ is the matrix mapping the basis $(q_{\unit\bullet},q_{\sigma\bullet},q_{\psi\bullet})^T$ to the ground state basis $(v_\bullet,h_\bullet,t_\bullet)^T$. Note that none of $q_{\unit\bullet},q_{\sigma\bullet},q_{\psi\bullet}$ are idempotents in the strict sense of the word, since they multiply together to give even tubes. To ensure they are normalized correctly, we require that they square to their associated even idempotents:
\be q_{\unit\bullet}^2 = q_\unit,\quad q_{\psi\bullet}^2 = q_\psi,\quad q_{\sigma\bullet}^2 = q_\sigma.\ee
In order for this to hold, we see that we need to take
\be q_{\unit\bullet} = \frac{A^{-2}}{2}(v_\bullet + A^3 t_\bullet),\quad q_{\psi\bullet} = \frac{A^{-2}}{2}(v_\bullet - A^3t_\bullet),\quad q_{\sigma\bullet} = \frac{1}{d}h_\bullet.\ee
Therefore, the matrix that maps the basis $(q_{\unit\bullet},q_{\sigma\bullet},q_{\psi\bullet})^T$ to the ground state basis $(v_\bullet,h_\bullet,t_\bullet)^T$ is 
\be V_{PP} = \begin{pmatrix} A^{-2}/2 & 0 & A^{-2}/2 \\ 0 & 1/d & 0 \\ A/2 & 0 & -A/2 \end{pmatrix}.\ee
This gives 
\be S_{PP} = \frac{A^2}{2} \begin{pmatrix} -1 & d & 1 \\ d & 0 & d \\ 1 & d & -1 \end{pmatrix},\quad T_{PP} = \begin{pmatrix} A^{-3} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0& 0& -A^{-3}.\end{pmatrix}.\ee
The prefactor of $A^2$ in $S_{PP}$ takes care of the $S^4=-\unit$ constraint for us. 
\ethan{There are some hints that would lead us to expect an $A^{-2}$ in front of $S$ instead.}

\underline{$\mathbf{(A,A)}$:} For the $(A,A)$ spin structure, we see that the $S$-matrix in the ground state basis $(e,v,h)^T$ is $S^{gs}_{(A,A)} = 1\oplus \sigma^x$. The matrix transforming from the idempotent basis $(m_\unit,m_\sigma^+,m_\psi)^T$ to the ground state basis is 
\be V_{AA}= \frac{1}{2}\begin{pmatrix}1&0&1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0\\ 1/d & 0 & -1/d \end{pmatrix},\ee
and so we obtain
\be S_{AA} = \frac{1}{2}\begin{pmatrix} 1 & d & 1 \\ d & 0 & -d \\ 1 & -d & 1 \end{pmatrix} = S_{Ising}.\ee

The $T$-matrix does not preserve the spin structure, as it sends $T : (A,A) \mapsto (A,P)$. As a map between the ground state bases $(e,v,h)^T_{AA}$ and $(e,t,h)_{AP}^T$, we have the convenient  
\be T_{AA\mapsto AP}^{gs} = \unit_{3\times 3}.\ee
The matrix mapping the idempotent basis $(m_\unit,m_\sigma^+,m_\psi)^T_{AP}$ onto the ground state basis $(e,t,h)_{AP}^T$  is
\be V_{AP} = \frac{1}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & A^{-3} & 0 \\ 1/d & 0 & -1/d \end{pmatrix},\ee
which tells us that 
\be T_{AA\mapsto AP} = V_{AP}^{-1} T_{AA\mapsto AP}^{gs} V_{AA} =  \begin{pmatrix}
1 &0&0 \\ 0&A^3&0\\0&0&1
\end{pmatrix}.\ee


\underline{$\mathbf{(P,A)}$:} Now for the $(P,A)$ spin structure, which is preserved by $T$ (as the $q$-type quasiparticles have well-defined self-statistics). First for the $S$-matrix, which maps the $PA$ spin structure to the $AP$ spin structure. As a map between the ground state basis $(e,v,t)_{PA}^T$ and the ground state basis $(e,t,h)_{AP}^T$, the $S$ matrix is
\be S^{gs}_{PA\mapsto AP} = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0& 0 \\ 0 & 0 & A^{-6} \\ 0&1& 0
\end{pmatrix}.\ee
The matrix that maps the idempotent basis $(q_\unit,q_\sigma,q_\psi)^T$ onto the ground state basis $(e,v,t)_{PA}^T$ is 
\be V_{PA} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 \\ 1/2 & 0 & 1/2 \\ A^3/2 & 0 & -A^3/2
\end{pmatrix},\ee
This means that in the idempotent basis, the $S$ matrix is 
\be S_{PA \mapsto AP} = V_{AP}^{-1} S^{top}_{PA \mapsto AP} V_{PA} = \begin{pmatrix}
d/2 & 1 & d/2 \\ 1 & 0 & -1 \\ -d/2 & 1 & -d/2
\end{pmatrix}.\ee

Now for $T$, which preserves the spin structure. In the ground state basis basis $(e,v,t)^T$, $T$ takes the form 
\be T^{gs}_{PA} = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & A^{-6} \\ 0&1&0 
\end{pmatrix}\ee
which tells us that in the idempotent basis, 
\be T_{PA}  = \begin{pmatrix}
A^{-3} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -A^{-3}
\end{pmatrix}\ee

\underline{$\mathbf{(A,P)}$:} Finally, we turn to the $(A,P)$ spin structure. 
Since the $S$-matrix must be symmetric, we can immediately write 
\be S_{AP \mapsto PA} =  S_{AP \mapsto PA}^T = \begin{pmatrix}
d/2 & 1 & -d/2 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\ d/2 & -1 & -d/2
\end{pmatrix}.\ee
As a map between the ground state bases $(e,t,h)^T_{AP}$ and $(e,v,h)^T_{AA}$, $T$ is 
\be T^{gs}_{AP \mapsto AA} = \begin{pmatrix}
1 &0&0 \\ 0&A^6 &0\\0&0&1
\end{pmatrix}.\ee
Therefore, in the idempotent basis, 
\be T_{AP\mapsto AA} = V_{AA}^{-1} T^{gs}_{AP\mapsto AA} V_{AP} = \begin{pmatrix}
1 &0&0 \\ 0&A^3&0\\0&0&1
\end{pmatrix}.\ee

\ethan{interpretation and some big matrices coming later}

- list idempotents? quasi-particle fusion? braiding? 

\section{super fusion category}
Goal: Define super fusion category for target audience. Target audience = physicists who have spent some time in Appendix E, of Kitaev 2006 anyon paper.

\subsection{Simple objects}
We associate objects with idempotents and simple objects with minimal idempotents.
In an ordinary fusion category simple objects have the defining feature that there endomorphisms are given by $\mathbb{C}$.
This is because any simple algebra over $\mathbb{C}$ is Morita equivalent to $\mathbb{C}$. 
We will denote these simple objects as M type.
As we saw in the Ising example, the endomorphisms of simple objects aren't always $\mathbb{C}$ but can be a simple super algebra over $\mathbb{C}$. 
As was the case for the image of $\sigma$ under condensation.
All simple super algebras are Morita equivalent to the clifford algebra with one odd generator $\mathbb{C} \ell_1$\cite{wall1964}.
This algebra is generated by two elements, one even call it $1$ and odd $\Gamma$ with $\Gamma^2 = 1$.
A generic element $x$ in the algebra $Cl(1)$ is a complex linear combination of $1$ and $\Gamma$.
The simplest vector space representing this algebra is the super vector space $\mathbb{C}^{1|1}$.
We will denote simple objects whose endomorphism algebra is $\mathbb{C} \ell_1$ as Q type objects.
In summary we have 
\begin{align}
\vcenter{\xymatrix @!0 @M=1mm @C=25mm{
& \text{End}(x) = \mathbb{C} \ar@{<->}[rr] &   &\text{x is a simple M type object}&  \\
&\text{End}(x) = \mathbb{C} \ell_1 \ar@{<->}[rr]  &  &\text{x is a simple Q type object}&
	}}
\end{align}

$$
$$
- review irreducible representations of super algebra's via \cite{jozefiak1988}??

- Duality axiom?
$$
$$



A defining feature of a simple object is the quantum dimension
\begin{align}
d_x = \text{Tr} \; x = \text{picture}
\end{align}

\subsection{Fusion space}

The set of input data for a super fusion category will not only constitute a list of simple objects, there types (Q or M) but also there fusion rules.
The fusion rules can be encapsulated by integers
\begin{align}
N_{c}^{ab}  = 0, 1, \cdots p, p+1, \cdots p+q+1
\end{align}
that denote $p$ even and $q$ odd ways that $a$ and $b$ can fuse to $c$.
Hence the vector space assigned to fusion of $a$ and $b$ into $c$ is $\mathbb{C}^{p|q}$.
\begin{align}
V^{ab}_c \cong \mathbb{C}^{p|q}
\end{align}
For any vector $\ket{\psi} \in V^{ab}_c$ we will denote its grading by $|\psi| \in \{ 0, 1\}$, where $0$ is even parity and $1$ is odd.
If any of the particles are Q type, one always as many even fusion spaces as odd ones i.e., the space is of the form $\mathbb{C}^{p|p}$.
This follows from the odd endomorphism of the $Q$ type particle which results in an isomorphism of the even and odd fusion spaces (PICTURE).
\dave{Can we show $m \tp m \rightarrow q$ is not allowed? This seems plausible.}
\dave{Contrast an $m \tp m \rightarrow m$ fusion space of super dimension $(p|p)$ with a $q \tp q \rightarrow m$ fusion space of super dimension $(p|p)$.}
The fact that the fusion vertices involving $Q$ type particles allow fermions to freely enter and exit the fusion space is reminiscent of superconductivity. 

Taking tensor products super vector spaces requires an ordering on all vectors in the tensor product.
We will denote this by a subscript $V^{ab}_{c,n}$.
When we are only talking about one fusion vertex we may omit the subscript.
Interchanging two indices may result in the interchange of two fermions, for which we would pick up a minus sign. 
Thus the fusion category has a canonical braiding given by the Koszul sign rule:
%\dave{Need to think about tensoring over endmorphisms, how these play together, and also when we 'extend' the vector space so that local moves implement tensoring over endomorphisms.}
%\begin{align}
%P_{12}: \; \; &V^{ab}_{c,1} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xy}_{z,2} \rightarrow V^{ab}_{c,2} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xy}_{z,1} \\
%		  & \ket{\psi}\tp_\mathbb{C} \ket{\eta}  \mapsto (-1)^{|\psi| |\eta|} \ket{\psi} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} \ket{\eta}
%\end{align}
\begin{align}
\vcenter{\xymatrix @!0 @M=1mm @C=42mm{
 &P_{12}: \; \;V^{ab}_{c,1} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xy}_{z,2} \ar[r]            & V^{ab}_{c,2} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xy}_{z,1} \\
		  &\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \ket{\psi}\tp_\mathbb{C} \ket{\eta}  \ar@{|->}[r] & (-1)^{|\psi| |\eta|} \ket{\psi} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} \ket{\eta}
	}} \quad \quad \ket{\psi} \in V^{ab}_{c} \;\; \text{and} \;\;  \ket{\eta} \in V^{xy}_{z}
\end{align}
which just says that if both $\ket{\psi}$ and $\ket{\eta}$ are odd vectors, then we must pick up a Kozul sign when we interchange there ordering. 

When we take tensor products of fusion spaces to create fusion digrams we have extra local relations inherited by the Q type particles.
 These relations are given by by shutteling a fermion from one fusion vertex to another:
 \begin{align}
 \LocalRelationLeft \sim \LocalRelationRight
 \end{align}
Hence a tensor product taken over a Q type particle should be quotiented by these isomorphisms:
\begin{align}
 &V^{ab}_{x,2} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xc}_{d,1}\quad  \text{is replaced by} \quad V^{ab}_{x,1} \tp_{\text{End}(x)} V^{xc}_{d,1} 
\end{align}
Where we define
\begin{align}
V^{ab}_{x,1} \tp_{\text{End}(x)} V^{xc}_{d,1} \equiv V^{ab}_{x,2} \tp_{\mathbb{C}}V^{xc}_{d,1}/\langle (V^{ab}_{x,2} \circ f_3) \tp_{\mathbb{C}}V^{xc}_{d,1} \sim V^{ab}_{x,2} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} (f_3\circ V^{xc}_{d,1}) \rangle
\label{qtensor}
\end{align}
for all $f \in \text{End}(x)$.
We will also sometimes use the short hand notation $\tp_x$ for $\tp_{\text{End}(x)}$.
This is so fundamental devote all of the next subsection to discuss it.

\subsection{Tensor product}
Here we discuss the explicit details of how to take tensor products. 
For an M type particle the tensor product is over $\mathbb{C}$ as usual. 
This is not the case for tensoring over a Q type particle, which we will now focus on.

We want to perform the quotient in equation (\ref{qtensor}).
To do so we will simply take the quotient by imposing that all physical vectors must live in an invariant subspace of $V^{ab}_x \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xc}_d$ under the action of $\text{End}(x)$. 
For a Q type particle we have two generators of $\text{End}(x)$ and each results in an isomorphism of the fusion spaces defined by
\begin{align}
&\vcenter{\xymatrix @!0 @M=1mm @C=42mm{
 &L_f: \; \;V^{ab}_{x} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xc}_{d} \ar[r]            & V^{ab}_{x} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xc}_{d}  \\
		  &\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \ket{\psi}\tp_\mathbb{C} \ket{\eta}  \ar@{|->}[r] & (f\ket{\psi}) \tp_{\mathbb{C}} (f^{-1} \ket{\eta})  
		  }} \quad \quad f \in \text{End}(x)\\
		  \\		  
&		  \vcenter{\xymatrix @!0 @M=1mm @C=42mm{
		  &R_f: \; \;V^{ay}_{d} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{bc}_{y} \ar[r]            & V^{ay}_{d} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{bc}_{y} \\
		  &\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \ket{\psi}\tp_\mathbb{C} \ket{\eta}  \ar@{|->}[r] & (f\ket{\psi}) \tp_{\mathbb{C}} (f^{-1} \ket{\eta})
	}}	\quad \quad f \in \text{End}(y)
	\end{align}
We see that the odd endomorphisms of the object which you are tensoring over then turn into even endomorphisms of the fusion space. 
Tensoring over endomorphisms in a fusion space is now equivalent to requiring the fusion space to be an invariant subspace of the $L_f$ and $R_f$. 
Said another way, any vectors related by application of $L_f$ or $R_f$ are equivalent.
Thus it is natural to call $L_f$ and $R_f$ guage transormation since they encode redundancy in the vector space.
It will sometimes be useful to do calculations in the ``extended" vector space, i.e., where we compute with representatives of vectors in each isomorphism class, and impose that any diagrammatic manipulation commutes with all endomorphisms generated by $L_f$ and $R_f$. 
Then we can project back into the physical subspace after doing calculations. 
This is can be done provided that $L_f$ and $R_f$ to commute on any fusion tree, for example,
\begin{align}
L_{f, 32}L_{g,21} V^{ab}_{x,3} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xc}_{y,2} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{yd}_{w,1} = L_{g,21} L_{f, 32} V^{ab}_{x,3} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xc}_{y,2} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{yd}_{w,1} 
\end{align}
for all $f \in \text{End}(x)$ and $g \in \text{End}(y)$. 
A moments reflection realizes that this must be the case, since each operator either introduces two fermions or acts as the identity, hence they must commute. 
Although they may have a nontrivial action on the fusion spaces.
From now on we will always mean tensor product over $\mathbb{C}$ unless specified otherwise.

\subsection{F-symbols}
We also have $F$-symbols defined via 
\begin{align}
F^{abc}_d: \; \; \bigoplus_x V^{ab}_{x,2} \tp_{\text{End}(x)} V^{xc}_{d,1} \rightarrow \bigoplus_y V^{ay}_{d,1} \tp_{\text{End}(y)} V^{bc}_{y,2}
\end{align}
The F-symbols should commute with the gauge transformations:
\begin{align}
	\vcenter{\xymatrix @!0 @M=1mm @R=30mm @C=42mm{
		 \bigoplus_x V^{ab}_x \otimes V^{xc}_d \ar[d]^{L_{f}}\ar[r]^{F^{abc}_d}& \bigoplus_y V^{ay}_d \otimes V^{bc}_y \ar[d]^{R_{g}} \\
		\bigoplus_x V^{ab}_x \otimes V^{xc}_d  \ar[r]^{F^{abc}_d}  & \bigoplus_y V^{ay}_d \otimes V^{bc}_y	
	}} 
	{ \quad\quad \forall f \in \oplus_x \text{End}(x), \; \; g \in \oplus_y \text{End}(y)}
	\label{Fcommute}
\end{align}
 Or explicitly in matrix form we have
 $$
 F^{abc}_d  L_f=   R_g F^{abc}_d
 $$

As with the bosonic case, these F-symbols are subject to the pentagon equation.
We modify the pentagon equation to include both M and Q type particles:

	\label{endoPentagon}
\end{align}
where we have used the notation that $\tp_x \equiv \tp_{\text{End}(x)}$ where the endomorphisms are taken over the object in the tensor product.
This is indeed how (\ref{endoPentagon}) differs from the ``super pentagon" equation which has already appeared in the literature REFXXX.

If one were to work in the extended vector space (i.e., forget about tensoring over endomorphisms) you would have exactly the super pentagon equation.
Thus one way to solve the endo-pentagon equation is by finding a solution to the super pentagon equation subject to the constraint (\ref{Fcommute}).

\dave{We should think about to what extent all super fusion categories can be realized by fermion condensation}

\dave{We should also ask when this process is reversible, i.e., can we ``guage" fermion parity and get back to a bosonic fusion category}

\dave{Is there an underlying bosonic fusion category associated with every super fusion category? Usher answered this in the case with no Q type particles, and it was yes.} 

\dave{(*not sure if something like this is needed. Maybe to properly define the $L_f$ and $L_g$. But since in the Hamiltonian we will have odd vertices with identity lines coming out of them, it may be useful to comment on this. Also it may be useful to have a way to add a fermion to the termination of a line at a marked point*)
That is for $a$ a simple Q type object we have
\begin{align}
\alpha_a: \; \; \mathbb{C} \ell_1 \rightarrow V^{a 0 }_a \quad \quad \beta_a: \; \; \mathbb{C} \ell_1 \rightarrow V^{0a }_a.

\subsection{Pivotal structure}
Here we remark on the pivotal structure of the super fusion category.
We have the frobenius Schur indicator given by \dave{Maybe this is jsut tensor over $\mathbb{C}$.}
\begin{align}
\kappa_a: \;\; V^{a \bar{a}} \tp_{\text{End}(\bar{a})} V_{\bar{a}a} \rightarrow V^a_a
\end{align}
which is a special case of the pivot \dave{also here this is jsut tensor over $\mathbb{C}$.}:
%\dave{Could either do this (and also specify the dual spaces)}
%\begin{align}
%A^{ab}_c:&\;\; V^{\bar{a}a} \tp_{\text{End}({a})}  V^{ab}_c \rightarrow V_{\bar{a} c}^b \\
%B^{ab}_c:&\;\; V^{ab}_c \tp_{\text{End}(b)}  V^{b\bar{b}} \rightarrow V^{a}_{c\bar{b}}
%\end{align}
%--OR--
\begin{align}
X^{ab}_c: \; \; V_{\bar{c} c} \tp_{\text{End}(c)} V^{ab}_c \tp_{\text{End}(b)} V^{b \bar{b}} \rightarrow V^{\bar{c} a}_{\bar{b}}
\end{align}

Consistency with pivoting

\section{Fusion category review}
In this section we give a brief review of fusion categories. 
%Physically one can think of the diagrams as the world lines of ``particles" in a $1+1$ dimensional theory.
%For example this could be considered as the topological theory associated to a gapped boundary of a $2+1$ dimensional topological phase. 
must add:

- identity object

- duality axiom

- normalizations/quantum dimensions

- inner product

A fusion category {\cal C} is a collection of data; a list of simple objects $\{a, b, \cdots, \}$, fusion rules $N_{ab}^c$, and F-symbols. 
Physically we think of a simple object as the collection of states which is invariant under local operations. 
More formally we would say that the space of maps from $a$ to it'self is just a complex number times the identity\begin{align}
\text{End}(a,a) \cong \mathbb{C} \text{id}_a.
\end{align}
This is the definition of a {\em simple object} in a fusion category {\cal C}. 
One could consider objects that aren't simple, but we require that such an object always decomposes into a direct sum of simple objects, for example, $A = \oplus_i x_i$, where each $x_i$ is simple. 
In this case we have $\text{Hom}(A,A)= \oplus_i \text{Hom}(x_i,x_i)$ (picture). 
This is the definition of {\em semisimple}, which says that each object can always be decomposed into a finite sum of simple objects.

Diagrammatically we represent this space as a set of labeled points on a circle or line. (picture).
Physically these particles should be thought of as local excitations which are well separated.
The ``time evolution" maps this set of states to another on a circle or a line (picture). 
During time evolution two neighbouring particles may be brought together and can fuse.
Such a process is called fusion and given the semi-simplicity condition, we know that the result can be split into a direct sum of particles.
We will label the fusion space that takes $a \otimes b$ to $c$ by $V_{ab}^c \cong \text{Hom}(a\otimes b, c)$. 
The dimension of this vector space is known as the fusion multiplicity $N_{ab}^c = \text{dim} V_{ab}^c$. 
We can choose a basis for this fusion space by $v_{ab; \mu}^c \in V_{ab}^c$ with $\mu = 1, \cdots, N_{ab}^c$, diagrammatically we write,
\begin{align}
v_{ab; \mu}^c = \text{(picture)}.
\end{align}
There is the adjoint space $V_{c}^{ab}$ which splits particle $c$ into particles $a$ and $b$.
The identity operator on the space $a \otimes b$ is given by 
\begin{align}
\text{id}_a \otimes \text{id}_b \cong \oplus_c V^{ab}_c \circ V^c_{ab}
\end{align}
Indeed, any evolution of particles can be decomposed in this way, 
%\begin{align}
%V_{x_1 x_2 \cdots x_r}^{y_1 y_2 \cdots y_w} = \oplus V^{y_1 y_2}_{z_1} \otimes V^{z_1 y_2}_{z_2} \otimes \cdots \otimes V^{z_{w-1} y_w}_{z_w} \circ V^{z_w}_{z_{w+1} x_r} \otimes V^{z_{w+1}}_{ z_{w+2} x_{r-1}} \otimes \cdots \otimes V^{z_{w+r-1}}_{x_1 x_2}
%\end{align}
\begin{align}
V_{x_1 x_2 \cdots}^{y_1 y_2 \cdots}  = \oplus_z V^{y1 y2}_z \circ V^{z y_3 \cdots}_{x_1 x_2 \cdots }
\end{align}
applying this rule recursively in the fusion and splitting spaces allows one to decompose the operator into fusion and splitting vectors. 

Of course this decomposition is arbitrary, we weren't forced to fuse $y_1$ and $y_2$ first, we could have equally well fused $y_2$ and $y_3$ first. 
Since the resulting vector spaces are isomorphic, we know that there has to be an isomorphism between these fusion processes. 
The isomorphism is known as the F-symbol and defines the linear map, \dave{need to add notation for tracking the spaces.}
\begin{align}
F^{abc}_d: \oplus_x V^{ab}_x \tp V^{xc}_{d} \rightarrow \oplus_y V^{ay}_d \tp V^{bc}_y
\end{align}
We will often adopt the notation for matrix elements of the F-symbol in a particular basis given by,
\begin{align}
v^{ab}_{x; \mu} \tp v^{x c}_{d; \nu} = \sum_{\sigma, y \rho} \left[ F^{abc}_d \right]_{\mu x \nu ; \sigma y \rho} v^{ay}_{d; \rho} \tp v^{bc}_{y; \sigma}
\end{align}
and diagrammatically this is written (picture).

 - The F-symbols are subject to a consistency condition known as the pentagon equation
....

The pentagon equation must be compatible with the pivotal structure. 
- Do the $F^2$ frobenius schur thing.
