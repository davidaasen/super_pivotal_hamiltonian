\subsection{Ising TQFT}
Here we introduce the Ising TQFT via Kauffamann and Lins\cite{Lins1994}. We choose $A = e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{16}}$, a primitive 16th root of unity. 
We label the identity particle $1$, Ising anyon $\sigma$ and the fermion $\psi$.
The quantum dimensions are
\be
d_1 = 1 \quad d_\sigma = -A^2 - A^{-2} \quad d_\psi =1 
\ee
The four different choices $A = \pm ie^{\pm i\pi/8}$ all give us positive quantum dimensions $d = \sqrt{2}$.

for $C_2$. The first node in the $C_2$ Dynkin diagram is the (fermionic) vacuum, and the second node is $\beta$, the image of $\sigma$ under condensation. } 
\end{figure}


\subsection{Condensing $\psi$}
In this subsection we describe our procedure for performing fermion condensation in the Ising theory. While we are indeed condensing the fermionic $\psi$ particle in Ising, the term ``fermion condensation'' is a bit misleading, as what we will actually do is perform {\it boson} condensation of the bosonic bound state of the emergent fermion $\psi$ and an additional physical fermion. 

First, we notice that $\unit$ and $\psi$ form a fusion sub-algebra of the Ising fusion rules.
We would like to ``condense" the $\psi$ particle by modding out this sub-algebra.
Modding out by this sub-algebra is not straightforward, as the $\psi$ particle is fermionic in both spin and statistics:
\begin{align}
\Spin = (-1) \times  \PsiIdentity
\qquad \qquad \TwoPsiExchange =  (-1) \times\TwoPsiIdentity
\end{align}
%which means that it cannot be identified with the vacuum. Indeed, performing such an identification would result in a trivial theory \dave{Show picture.}


To remedy this, we introduce a spin structure which compensates for the fermionic nature of the $\psi$ particle in the condensate. 
Spin structures will play a large role in the following and so warrant a brief discussion. 
$$
$$
(Insert some discussion on spin structures here?)
$$
$$
Physically, the spin structure can be thought of as a theory of physical fermions, for example a $p+ip$ superconductor.
The condensation process then accounts for taking the emergent fermionic particle, pairing it with the physical fermion and then condensing the bosonic composite particle\dave{Refer to figure.}.

Some of the symmetry of the theory is reduced when we condense the composite particles. 
This is because the spin structure ocurrs along on a two dimensional surface embedded in the TQFT. 
It is useful to introduce some notation for $\psi$ particles that terminate on this defect. 
In Fig.~\ref{BackWall} we denote a $\psi$ world line that goes straight back into the defect by a small box. 
\begin{figure}
  \centering
    \includegraphics{BackWall.pdf}
      \caption{Back wall. \dave{need to number things.}.}
      \label{BackWall}
\end{figure}
Locally these terminations of $\psi$ lines look like
\begin{align}
\PsiFermion 
\end{align}
One can check that the composite of a $\psi$ line terminating on the spin structure is bosonic. Indeed under a twist we have,
\begin{align}
\PsiFermion  \rightarrow \PsiFermionTwist = \PsiFermion 
\end{align}
Where the equality follows from the fact the the $\psi$ particle picks up a minus sign due to its topological spin being minus one, and the rotated spin structure also picks up a minus sign. 
The defect termionations are also bosonic under exchange,
\begin{align}
\TwoFermion \rightarrow \TwoFermionExchange = \TwoFermion
\end{align}
where one minus sign comes from the exchange of the $\psi$ particles, and the other from the exchange of the spin structure fermions \dave{better name?}. 
Although locally this defect behaves as a boson, it is not a usual boson. 
The physical fermion that's attached to it still feels the spin structure. 
Indeed when the box passes over a non-trivial cycle of the manifold it can pick up a factor $\pm1$ depending on the spin structure.  \dave{Need notation from spin structure section.}

\dave{Something about $\text{Pin}^{\pm}$ structures I never understood.}
One should be able to evaluate any pair of fermions terminating at the defect into a complex number.
In order to evaluate the picture into a number we require them to be in a standard form, and denote there evaluation by $\lambda$:
\begin{align}
\PsiEnd  = \lambda \times \text{(vaccuum)}
\label{EvalPsiPsi}
\end{align}
where $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$. 
Reflection about the horizontal axis acts as an anti-linear operator, and so we have(\dave{may want to change this to about the vertical axis})
\begin{align}
\lambda^{*} = \left( \PsiEnd \right) ^{\dagger}  = \PsiEndExchange = - \lambda,
\label{phase}
\end{align}
implying that $\lambda = - \lambda^*$ and therefore $\lambda$ is purely imaginary number. 
It will depend on whether we choose a $\text{Pin}^{\pm}$ structure \dave{Need to understand these.}. 
We will see later on that consistency between $F$-moves and fermion removal requires that we choose $\lambda = A^4$, placing a nontrivial constraint on $A$. 

\subsection{isotopies of $\cal{C}/\psi$}
%and so we can condense the $\psi$ particle by modding out this sub-algebra, provided that we introduce the spin structures needed to make this procedure legitimate. 
Now that we have worked out the graphical rules for the condensate we can check what implications it has on the Ising Fusion category.
We will denote this theory by $\cal{C}/\psi$ since we have enforced that the identity object in Ising to be isomorphic to $\psi$.
Many subtelties crop up when one does this. 
We have already seen that it necessitates a spin structure. 
Another subtelty is that multiplication of diagrams as to be modified, indeed we need to account for an equivalence relation arising from the isotopy of the fermionic objects. 
This is largest difference between a super fusion fusion category and a bosonic one.

We first observe that any diagram with a $\psi$ line can be absorbed into the condensate at the expense of a phase by using (\ref{EvalPsiPsi}).
Thus in the target theory the only objects remaining will be $\sigma$ lines with possible fermions attached. 
We will denote the image of $\sigma$ under the condensation procedure as $\beta$, and we will introduce a blue dot as a compact notation for a $\psi$ line that terminates on both $\beta$, and the spin structure. 
Diagrammatically any section of the $\beta$ line may look like
\begin{align}
\FubeXss \qquad \qquad \FubeXsds,
\end{align}
Indeed these are also the generators of the endorphisms of $\beta$.
Since we have one even generator and one odd generator we see that $\text{End}(\beta) \cong \mathbb{C}\ell_1$ \dave{Mention Q type here? Elsewhere? will decide as structure gets put together.}.
These odd endomorphisms already modify the tensor product of the theory, which we discuss below in Section \ref{IsingTensorProduct}


As shown in \ref{phase} the process of removing two fermions results in a phase:
\begin{align}
\SigmaDotDot\; = A^4\; \FubeXss
\end{align}
where we take $A^4 = i$ (although $A^4 = -i$ is also fine). 
Similarly, exchanging the ferimons fermions also results in a minus sign,
\begin{align}
\SigmaDotDot\;  &= - \; \SigmaDotDotExchange.
\end{align}
From the braiding endowed in the parent theory one ends up with some phases due to sliding the fermions past cups and caps in diagrams.
For example, we can compute,
\begin{align}
\DotSlidea =
\DotSlideb =
-A^4\DotSlidec =
-A^4\DotSlided 
\end{align}
Hence we have,
\begin{align} \label{dotslides}
\CapDotRight\; &= - A^4 \; \CapDotLeft & \CupDotRight\; &=  A^4 \; \CupDotLeft.
\end{align}
These phases can be derived completely from the {\it braiding data} of the Ising theory, and must be such that going around a circular $\beta$ loop gives a factor of $-1$, which enforces the constraint that $A^8 = -1$. In more general examples, the braiding data in the parent theory will not be such that this is the case, this precludes an ability to have $q$-type objects with $\cl_1$ endomorphism algebras. 

\dave{Add some pictures showing why these isotopies are compatible with the spin structure.}

\subsection{Tensor product in $\cal{C}/\psi$}
\label{IsingTensorProduct}
\ethan{I'm not sure if we should call this the $\tp$. I think we should maybe reserve $\tp$ for horizontal superposition as usual, and just call tube stacking tube algebra multiplication.}
The dots representing the points where $\psi$ lines end on $\beta$ lines can slide around on $\beta$ lines freely, provided that we keep track of the phase factors \eqref{dotslides} associated with passing them over caps and cups. 
This has non-trivial implications on the tensor products, indeed defining the tensor product of the squares above by stacking,
\begin{align}
\FubeXss \otimes \FubeXsds = \overset{\FubeXss}{\FubeXsds} \sim \overset{\FubeXsds }{\FubeXss}
\label{Exampletp}
\end{align}
To the right, we have denoted an equivalent state using isotopy. 
If we are interested in pictures modulo local relations, we should define our tensor product so that it accounts for this equivalence relation. 
For example, naively tensoring over $\mathbb{C}$ can yield the following,
\begin{align}
V^{\beta 1}_\beta \tp_\mathbb{C} V^{\beta 1}_\beta = \overset{\FubeXss}{\FubeXss} \oplus \overset{\FubeXss}{\FubeXsds} \oplus \overset{\FubeXsds}{\FubeXss} \oplus \overset{\FubeXsds_2}{\FubeXsds_1}
\end{align}
from which we naively conclude that the tensor product of the two vector spaces, each which has one even state and one odd state, results in a four dimensional vector space of two even state and two odd states. 
However, it's clear that not all the vectors appearing on the right hand side are linearly independant, indeed the middle two are related by isotopy, and so are the outer two. 
Hence we have to quotient out by isotopy. 

We will incorporate this equivalence relation into the tensor product of the super fusion category.
We are already used to modding out by a similar equivalence relation with the ordinary tensor product of a vector space of the complex numbers. 
Indeed, the analog of shuttling the dot past the junction is shuttling a complex number from one vector to another in a complex vector space we have 
\begin{align}
(\alpha \ket{x}) \tp_\mathbb{C} \ket{y} \sim \ket{x} \tp_\mathbb{C} (\alpha \ket{y}) \quad \forall \alpha \in \mathbb{C}
\end{align}
Similarly in a bosonic fusion category, our vectors are pictures, and the the tensor product glues those pictures together. 

In doing so we have to allow for arbitrary pictures  that matching the boundary conditions to be shuttled past the gluing junction. 
Shuttling a picture past the junction is just an endomorphism of the boundary condition. \dave{Include such abstract stuff? Also who to reference?}
Thus for gluing two pictures $P(Y_i)$ on surfaces $Y_i$  along a boundary $S \in \partial Y_i$ we have the natural extension to \dave{picture.}
\begin{align}
P_{(Y_1, S)} \tp_{\text{End}(S)}P_{(Y_2,S)} \equiv P_{(Y_1,S)} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} P_{(Y_2,S)} /\sim
\end{align}
where the equivalence relation $\sim$ is given by,
\begin{align}
 (P_{(Y_1,S)} \text{End}(S)) \tp_{\mathbb{C}} P_{(Y_2,S)}  \sim P_{(Y_1,S)} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} (\text{End}(S) P_{(Y_2,S)}). 
\end{align}
This formulation of tensor products looks rather abstract, but at the same time familiar from the context of guage theories. 
It is useful to think of the tensoring over endomorphisms as ``integrating" over all gauge field configurations, consistent with the boundary conditions.

In this light, we will implement the ``guage" transformations with a series of isomorphims. 
At the end of the day it is a choice on whether we represent a quantum state by choosing one vector in the equivalence relation, or if we symmetrize over all possible states. 
Indeed, when writing down the string net Hamiltonian we will implement the symmetrization over all states by simply adding those terms to the Hamiltonian. 

Lets revisit the example in (\ref{Exampletp}). 
To tensor product over the endomorphisms of the boundary, which in this case is $\text{End}(\beta)$ we have \dave{obviously we have to clean this up.},
\begin{align}
\FubeXss \otimes_{\text{End}(\beta)} \FubeXsds  = \overset{\FubeXss}{\FubeXss}  / \sim \\
\text{where} 
 \overset{\FubeXss}{\FubeXss}  \sim  \overset{ \FubeXss }{\FubeXss} 
\end{align}
as anticipated.
We are also free to choose a single representative of this equivalence class which, for example
\begin{align}
\FubeXss \otimes_{\text{End}(\beta) }\FubeXsds = \overset{\FubeXss}{\FubeXsds} =  \FubeXsds \otimes_{\text{End}(\beta)}  \FubeXss
\end{align}
At this point, it may appear like we've introduced an unnecessary complication. 
The tensor product we originally looked at in (\ref{Exampletp}) ended up giving the right result. 
However, in the general theory it will be useful to explicitly write down a basis for these endomorphisms to make the pentagon equation explicit.

\subsection{F-symbols}
The F-symbols provide linear relations on diagrams.
Using the F-symbols from the original Ising theory, one can simply infer the linear relations on the diagrams in the condensed theory. 
To do this we first take a diagram in the Ising theory apply an F-move, then remove all $\psi$ lines through condensation. 
For example, we have,
\begin{align}
\TwoLine =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \CupCap +  \CupCapPsi \right) \quad \text{and} \quad \CupCapPsi \rightarrow A^{-4} \CupCapDots
\end{align}
using these relations we can infer both of the non-trivial F-moves of the condensed theory:
\begin{align}
\TwoLine\; & = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \CupCap \; + \;A^{-4} \CupCapDots \right) \\
\CupCap \; &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(\TwoLine \; + \; \TwoLineDots \right).
\end{align}
%These are all the linear relations on the diagrams that we get.

\ethan{commented out the discussion on tensoring over endos as it plays no role in the Ising theory and we probably shouldn't repeat what we'll be saying in section 6 regardless. Also, our choice for the F-moves (two in two out) is different from the one in the tensoring over endos discussion (one in four out) which makes talking about it here a bit unwieldy.}
\begin{comment}
By just doing the diagrammatics, we have avoided the subtlety of tensoring over the endomorphisms of $\beta$.
More formally, the F-symbol is a change of basis in the Hom space $V^{abc}_d$ \dave{explained in intro to Ising TQFT?}
\begin{align}
F^{abc}_d: \oplus_x V^{ab}_x \tp_{\text{End}(x)} V^{xc}_d \rightarrow \oplus_y V^{ay}_d \tp_{\text{End}(y)} V^{cd}_y
\end{align}
It is useful to choose an explicit basis for the splitting spaces and use $F$-symbols which are purely complex subject to some constraints, i.e., they must commute with the ``gauage transformations". 
To that end, we pick a basis for the splitting spaces, and explicitly write down the matrices which induce the ``gauage" transformations. 

Hence we will consider all pictures in the ``extended" space $V^{ab}_x \tp_\mathbb{C} V^{xc}_d$, find all solutions to $F$-symbols subject to the constraint that they commute with the endomorphisms. 
Then we will project back into the ``physical" vector space $V^{ab}_x \tp_\text{End}(x) V^{xc}_d$ by symmetrizing over all the gauge transformations.

In the cases of interest, the generators of $\text{End}(x)$ are isomorphisms, lets choose a basis $f_i$ for these isomorphisms.
We wish to solve for 
\begin{align}
V^{ab}_x \tp V^{xc}_d /\prod_i \langle V^{ab}_x f_i \tp V^{xc}_d \sim V^{ab}_x  \tp f_i V^{xc}_d  \rangle
\label{physicalspace}
\end{align}
Lets do this by introducing a set of matrices $M(f_i)$ defined via,
\begin{align}
M(f_i) V^{ab}_x \tp V^{xc}_d = (V^{ab}_x f_i )\tp (f_i^{-1} V^{xc}_d).
\end{align}
Notice that the matrices $M(f_i)$ are always even. 
Hence as a representation they are always of type M.
They are also complex linear in the $f_i$: $M(\alpha f_i + \beta f_j) = \alpha M(f_i) + \beta M(f_j) $ for all $ \alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}$.
Hence the $M(f_i)$ form a finite dimensional matrix algebra, and the physical space in (\ref{physicalspace}) is just an irreducible representation of this matrix algebra. 

The equivalence relation is now simply given by any two vectors related by some complex linear combination of the $M(f_i)$. 
Hence for the $F$-symbol, we require the following diagram to be commutative, 
\begin{align}
	\vcenter{\xymatrix @!0 @M=1mm @R=30mm @C=42mm{
		 \oplus_x V^{ab}_x \otimes V^{xc}_d \ar[d]^{M(f_x)}\ar[r]^{F^{abc}_d}& \oplus_y V^{ay}_d \otimes V^{bc}_y \ar[d]^{M(f_y)} \\
		\oplus_x V^{ab}_x \otimes V^{xc}_d  \ar[r]^{F^{abc}_d}  & \oplus_y V^{ay}_d \otimes V^{bc}_y	
	}} \quad \text{i.e.,} \quad F^{abc}_d M(f_x) = M(f_y) F^{abc}_d
\end{align}
for all $f_x \in \text{End}(x)$ and $f_y \in \text{End}(y)$.
We will return to this in Section??? and describe in more detail.

\subsection{Quasiparticle excitations and the center of $C_2$} \label{qps}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this section, we identify the quasiparticle excitations in the $C_2$ theory. As was first shown in the mathematical literature by Occneanu [ref] and later demonstrated in the physics community by [lan wen, nick, yuting], the quasiparticle excitations in bosonic theories derived from a category $\mcc$ are given by the elements of the Drinfeld center $\mcz(\mcc)$, which can be obtained by finding the simple modules of an algebra known as the {\it tube algebra}. With appropriate modifications accounting for spin structure issues, this same construction holds in the more general fermionic setting considered here. Briefly, the tube algebra 




The fubes are given by the string configurations 
\begin{align}
\FubeXXX \quad \FubesXs    \quad \FubeXss \quad \FubessX   \quad \FubesdXs \quad  \FubeXsds \quad \FubessdX
\end{align}
Each fube must come equipped with a spin structure, given by an element $\eta \in H^1(C,\zt) \cong \zt$, where $C$ is the cylinder. $\eta$ simply determines the nature of the boundary conditions for fermions which encricle the fube, and so the boundary conditions for fubes must obey a $\zt$ group structure. We have to be a little careful though, as mentioned earlier: contractible fermionic loops that twist fermion ribbons by $2\pi$ are associated with a $-1$ sign, and so the identity element in $H^1(C,\zt)$ corresponds to {\it anti-periodic} (or non-vorex) boundary conditions, with the nontrivial element corresponding to periodic (or vortex) boundary conditions.

We will denote the spin structure of a given fube with a subscript, either $A$ for anti-periodic/non-vortex sector or $P$ for periodic/vortex sector. 
Not every fube is consistent with each spin structure.
For example,
\begin{align}
\FubesdXs_A\;  = - \; \FubesdXs_A 
\end{align}
which follows from pulling the fermion around the boundary and so a minus sign is acquired. 
Meanwhile we have,
\begin{align}
\FubesXs_P \; = \; (A^4)^*\; \FubesXsa_P \; = (A^4)^* \; \FubesXsb_P =\;  (A^4)^* \FubesXsc_P \; = - \FubesXs_P.
\end{align}
All other fubes are nonzero for both spin structures.
Hence, a complete basis for fubes for the anti-peridioc sector is given by
\begin{align}
\FubeXXX_A \quad \FubesXs_A \quad \FubeXss_A \quad \FubessX_A    \quad  \FubeXsds_A \quad \FubessdX_A
\end{align}
while a basis for the periodic sector is given by,
\begin{align}
\FubeXXX_P\quad \FubeXss_P \quad \FubessX_P   \quad \FubesdXs_P \quad  \FubeXsds_P \quad \FubessdX_P
\end{align}

The tensor product in the fube algebra is given by stacking fubes and simplifying the resulting composite fube using local relations.  
For example, in the periodic sector we have
\begin{align}
\FubesdXs_P \; \times \; \FubesdXs_P \; = \; \RDotTwoa_P \; = \; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(\RDotTwob_P + \RDotTwoc_P \right) = 2 \; \FubeXXX_P
\end{align}

Note that when we annihilate fermions into the vacuum to derive relations like this, we have to be careful about the order in which we do it, which is why we can never create two fermions side-by-side at the same time slice. For example, if we create fermion 1 above fermion 2 in a diagram, we must annihilate them along a $\Sigma$ string where fermion 1 is above fermion 2.
Also, note that since the spin structures on two tubes being fused must agree on the boundary at which they are being fused, periodic tubes only admit nonzero tensor products with periodic tubes, and similarly for anti-periodic tubes.

Relations like the ones above allow us to find the primitive central idempotents of the tube algebra, which carry the same information as the simple modules of the tube algebra, which in turn correspond to the vector spaces left invariant under the action of tube fusion\footnote{also known as {\it fubing}}, which we finally identify as quasiparticles. 

To figure out the quasiparticle spectrum, we, as stated earlier, need to find the irreducible representations (or simple modules) of the tube algebra. For a review and more detailed discussion of the tube algebra in the fermionic setting we refer readers to \ref{tubeapp}. Since the tube algebra splits into a direct sum of tubes with different spin structures, its simple modules will split in a similar way. First, we turn to an analysis of tubes with anti-periodic boundary counditions. 

\subsubsection{Anti-periodic spin structure}

Let us first examine the subalgebra of tubes with no charge: that is, cylinders with empty boundary conditions on both their top and bottom. Writing this subalgebra as $\tube_0^A$, we see that it is generated by two even tubes:
\be \tube_0^A = \left\langle\; \FubeXXX,\; \FubesXs\;\right\rangle.\ee
The odd tube with a horizontal $\beta$ line and a single fermion is zero, since taking the fermion once around the cylinder shows that it is equal to minus itself. 
Since $\tube_0^A$ has two even generators, as an algebra it must be isomorphic to $\cc^{2|0}$. The idempotents associated with this sector are easy to compute: $\cc^{2|0}$ has two simple modules and so we get two quasiparticles, which we label by $m_\unit$ and $m_\psi$. Explicitly, they are 
\be m_\unit = \frac{1}{2}\left( \FubeXXX_A +\;\; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\FubesXs_A\right),\qquad m_\psi = \frac{1}{2} \left( \FubeXXX_A -\;\; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \FubesXs_A\right).\ee
One can check that these idempotents are central, primitive, and orthogonal, and as such are associated with a pair of zero-charge quasiparticles. 

Now we turn to the subalgebra $\tube^A_\beta$ of charged tubes: those whose top and bottom boundary conditions consist of a single marked point. There are two non-zero even tubes and two non-zero odd tubes:
\be \tube^A_\beta = \left\langle\; \FubeXss,\;\FubeXsds,\; \FubessX,\; \FubessdX\right\rangle,\ee
meaning that as an algebra, $\tube^A_\beta \cong \cc^{2|2}$. $\cc^{2|2}$ is isomorphic to both $\cl_2$ and $\cl_1\oplus \cl_1$, and so we know that this sector will contribute either one (if $\cl_2$) or two (if $\cl_1^{\oplus 2}$) quasiparticle excitations. 

In order to identify the idempotents of this subalgebra, we need to write down the multiplication rules. By using the local relations in the $C_2$ theory we can work out the multiplication table as follows, where $A\tp B$ means ``stack $A$ on top of $B$'', and where we always take fermions in the $A$ tube to have a larger normal order than fermions in the $B$ tube:
\be
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{3}
\begin{tabular}{c | c c c c r}
$\times$ in $\tube^A_{\beta} $          & $\FubeXss $ & $\FubeXsds $ & $\FubessX $&$ \FubessdX$  \\
\hline
$\FubeXss$ & $\FubeXss$ & $\ \FubeXsds$  & $\FubessX$ & $\FubessdX$  \\

$\FubeXsds$           & $\FubeXsds $& $i\ \FubeXss$ & $\FubessdX $& $i\ \FubessX  $\\

$\FubessX$          & $\FubessX $&$ -\ \FubessdX  $&$ e^{-i\pi/4}\ \FubeXss $&$ -e^{-i\pi/4}\ \FubeXsds $\\

$\FubessdX    $&$ \FubessdX $&$ -i\ \FubessX $&$ e^{-i\pi/4}\ \FubeXsds $&$ -e^{i\pi/4}\ \FubeXss$   \\
\end{tabular}
\ee
Note that in the above table, we've taken $A^4 = i$ for concreteness. Since the multiplication table is non-abelian, this algebra must be $\cl_2$, as $\cl_1\oplus\cl_1$ is abelian. 
In order to show that this is indeed the multiplication table of $\cl_2$, we perform the following re-scaling:
\be \FubeXsds \mapsto e^{-\pi i/4} \FubeXsds,
\qquad \FubessX \mapsto e^{5\pi i/8} \FubessX,\qquad \FubessdX \mapsto e^{3\pi i/8} \FubessdX.\ee
With this, the re-scaled multiplication table becomes 
\be
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{3}
\begin{tabular}{c | c c c c r}
$\times$ in $\tube^A_{\beta} $          & $\FubeXss $ & $\FubeXsds $ & $\FubessX $&$ \FubessdX$  \\
\hline
$\FubeXss$ & $\FubeXss$ & $\FubeXsds$  & $\FubessX$ & $\FubessdX$  \\
$\FubeXsds$           & $\FubeXsds $& $\FubeXss$ & $\FubessdX $& $\FubessX  $\\
$\FubessX$          & $\FubessX $&$ -\FubessdX  $&$ -\FubeXss $&$ \FubeXsds $\\
$\FubessdX    $&$ \FubessdX $&$ -\FubessX $&$ -\FubeXsds $&$ \FubeXss$   \\
\end{tabular}
\ee
Recall that $\cl_2$ has two even generators $1$ and $\gamma_1\gamma_2$, and two anticommuting odd generators $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ that square to $1$. We see that if we make the identifications
\be 1 =\FubeXss,\quad \gamma_1 =  \FubeXsds,\quad \gamma_2 = \FubessdX,\quad i\gamma_1\gamma_2 =  \FubessX,\ee
we have the required anticommutation relations $\{\gamma_1,\gamma_2\} = 0$, as well as the identities $\gamma_1^2 = \gamma_2^2 = 1$, and so indeed, $\tube^A_\beta \cong \cl_2$. 
%Since we have $c^\dagger c = i\gamma_1\gamma_2$ if $c = (\gamma_1 + i\gamma_2)/\sqrt{2}$, we have the intriguing relation 
%\be c^\dagger c = \FubessX.\ee
%That is, we see that the number operator is equal to the tube that implements the twist. This actually makes sense: each fermion on an anti-periodic tube gives a factor of $-1$ when twisted, and so twisting tubes gives a way of computing the (physical) fermion parity of the tube. 

We now turn to the task of identifying the quasiparticles (simple modules) of this algebra. 
Because of the Morita equivalence between $\cl_2$ and $\cc$, $\cl_2$ and $\cc$ must have the same simple modules (idempotents), and so the subalgebra $\tube^A_\beta$ must correspond to only one type of quasiparticle.

To see this directly, we note that since $\cl_2 \cong \End(\cc^{1|1})$, its simple modules (quasiparticles) can each be identified with the space $\cc^{1|1}$. It's easy to check that there are two different simple modules which we write as $m^{\pm}$, corresponding to the representations of $\cl_2$ $\rho^\pm : \cl_2 \ra \Aut(\cc^{1|1})$ given by $\rho^\pm(1) = \sigma^0,\rho^\pm(\gamma_1) = \sigma^x,$ and $\rho^\pm(\gamma_2) = \pm i\sigma^y$, where the $\gamma_i$ maintain their earlier identifications. This means that the two quasiparticle types $m^\pm$ associated with the two representations differ in the sign of the representation matrix of $\gamma_2$, meaning that we can write them as
\be m_\sigma^\pm = \frac{1}{2} \left(\FubeXss_A \pm e^{i\pi/8}\ \FubessX_A\right),\ee
since the second tube in the above expression is oddly isomorphic to $\gamma_2$. Note that we're letting each fube in the above expression represent its isomorphism class, which is why we haven't added any fubes in $\fld(C)^1$ with odd fermion parity to the expression for $m_\sigma^\pm$ (as they are isomorphic to the even-parity fubes in the expression for $m^\pm$) . 

This looks to give us two quasiparticles, which is a contradiction. The resolution to this is that the two simple modules $m^\pm$ are actually {\it oddly isomorphic} to one another, by virtue of the anti-periodic spin structures they possess. Creating a fermion on the top of the $\gamma_2$ tube (which corresponds to the isomorphism given by left multiplication by $\gamma_1$), dragging it around the $\gamma_2$ tube to the bottom, and then annihilating it (through the isomorphism given by right multiplication by $\gamma_1$) acts on the matrix representations as  $\rho^\pm(\gamma_2) \mapsto \rho^\mp(\gamma_2)$, and thus establishes an isomorphism $m^+\cong m^-$. Since only isomorphism classes of quasiparticles are physical, we can therefore identify the two modules $m_\sigma^\pm$ with a single quasiparticle. In what follows, we will choose $m_\sigma^+$ as the representative for the isomorphism class. 

We will examine the fusion rules and braiding properties of the three quasiparticles identified so far later. For now, we repeat our quasiparticle identification procedure for quasiparticles in the vortex sector, which possess spin structures with periodic boundary conditions around the cylinder. 

\subsubsection{Periodic (vortex) sector}

$\cl_1$ has only one simple module, namely $\cc^{1|1}$ with the matrix representation $\rho(1) = \sigma^0,\rho(\gamma)=\sigma^x$, and so will support only one quasiparticle

The explicit presentation for the $\cl_1$ quasiparticle is a bit more subtle. Since $\fld^P(C)$ is a graded superspace, we are prevented from adding field configurations with different fermion parity, and thus cannot form superpositions of the tubes in $\fube^P_0$. However, we note that in $\cl_1$, $1$ and $\gamma$ are isomorphic through multiplication by $\gamma$, which establishes an (odd) isomorphism between the two basis vectors in $\fube^P_0$. Since only isomorphism classes of field configurations are physical, we can identify the two fubes with one another, which form an orbit under multiplication by $\gamma$. For definiteness we will choose to represent this isomorphism class by the even-parity sector, and so we write the $\cl_1$ quasiparticle as (really? or just say idempotents have to be even?)
\be q_\sigma = \FubeXXX_P.\ee

Now for the periodic spin structure, corresponding to the subalgebra $\fube_\Sigma^P$. The multiplication table for $\fube_\Sigma^P$ is the same as the one for the $\fube_\Sigma^A$, modulo a few minus signs and conjugations. Explicitly, we obtain
\be
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{3}
\begin{tabular}{c | c c c c r}
$\tp$ in $\fube^P_{\Sigma} $          & $\FubeXss $ & $\FubeXsds $ & $\FubessX $&$ \FubessdX$  \\
\hline

$\FubeXss$ & $\FubeXss$ & $ \FubeXsds$  & $\FubessX$ & $\FubessdX$  \\

$\FubeXsds$           & $\FubeXsds $& $i\ \FubeXss$ & $\FubessdX $& $i\ \FubessX  $\\

$\FubessX$          & $\FubessX $&$ \ \FubessdX  $&$ e^{i\pi/4}\ \FubeXss $&$ e^{i\pi/4}\ \FubeXsds $\\

$\FubessdX    $&$ \FubessdX $&$ i\ \FubessX $&$ e^{i\pi/4}\ \FubeXsds $&$ e^{i3\pi/4}\ \FubeXss$   \\
\end{tabular}
\ee

As in the anti-periodic, we can do a re-scaling of the tubes to make the underlying algebraic structure more transparent. The most convenient re-scaling is 
\be \FubeXsds \mapsto e^{-\pi i/4} \FubeXsds,
\qquad \FubessX \mapsto e^{\pi i/8} \FubessX,\qquad \FubessdX \mapsto e^{-\pi i/8} \FubessdX.\ee
With this choice of re-scaling, the re-scaled multiplication table for $\fube_\Sigma^P$ is the same as re-scaled one for $\fube_\Sigma^A$, expect there are no minus signs, meaning that $\fube_\Sigma^P$ is commutative. Since we argued earlier that the only choices for $\fube_\Sigma^{A/P}$ were $\cl_1\oplus\cl_1$ or $\cl_2$, commutativity implies that we can set $\fube_\Sigma^P \cong \cl_1\oplus\cl_1$. To check this we need to do a little manipulation, since the multiplication table for $\fube_\Sigma^P$ doesn't look like a direct sum of two $\cl_1$ multiplication tables at first glance. To fix notation, we will write the two odd generators in $\cl_1\oplus\cl_1$ as $\gamma^+$ and $\gamma^-$, and the even generators as $1^+, 1^-$. If we define these generators in terms of the fubes by (keeping the phases explicit)
\be \unit^\pm = \frac{1}{2}\left(\FubeXss \pm e^{-i\pi/8}\FubessX\right),\qquad   \gamma^\pm = \frac{e^{-i\pi/4}}{2}\left(\FubeXsds \pm e^{-i\pi/8}\FubessdX\right)\ee
and then re-write the multiplication table for $\fube_\Sigma^P$, we see that we indeed get a $\langle \unit^+ ,\gamma^+\rangle \oplus \langle \unit^- \oplus \gamma^-\rangle =\cl_1\oplus\cl_1$ structure with $(\gamma^\pm)^2 = \unit^\pm$. Thus, there are two $\cl_1$-type quasiparticles corresponding to the $\fube_\Sigma^P$ subalgebra. Again, since only isomorphism classes of fubes are physical, we can write the two $\cl_1$-type quasiparticles in terms of even-parity fubes only:
\be q_\unit = \unit^+,\qquad q_\psi = \unit^-.\ee

To summarize, we have found six types of quasiparticles in the theory: three vortex quasiparticles associated with tubes possessing periodic spin structures, and three non-vortex quasiparticles associated with tubes possessing anti-periodic boundary spin structures. The three non-vortex quasiparticles are 
\be \ba & m_\unit = \frac{1}{2} \left( \FubeXXX_A  +\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\FubesXs_A\right),\ m_\psi = \frac{1}{2} \left( \FubeXXX_A - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \FubesXs_A\right),\\ & m_\sigma^\pm = \frac{1}{2} \left(\FubeXss_A \pm e^{i\pi/8}\ \FubessX_A\right),\ea\ee
while the three vortex quasiparticles are 
\be q_\unit = \frac{1}{2}\left(\FubeXss + e^{-i\pi/8}\FubessX\right),\ q_\psi = \frac{1}{2}\left(\FubeXss - e^{-i\pi/8}\FubessX\right),\ q_\sigma = \FubeXXX.\ee

\subsection{Obtaining the quasiparticle fusion rules}

With all idempotents at hand we are in a place to compute the fusion rules. The process is the same as discussed in Section \ref{FindingFusionRules}.
We take three idempotents and ask if there exists a linear combination of pants that will take two of the idempotents to the third. The number of linearly independant maps gives the fusion multiplicity.
Computationally it is easier to search for pairs of pants that are invariant under application of each idempotent. 
For example, suppose we wanted to find the fusion rule for $q_\sigma \otimes m_1$.
We first note that the spin structure boundary conditions require that they fuse to a vortex (a fube with a periodic spin structure). Furthurmore, since both $m_1$ and $q_\sigma$ have flux and no charge, we know that the pants cannot have any charge lines. Since there is only one resulting fube that has no charge lines and periodic  boundary conditions, namely $q_\sigma$, we know that the pair of pants desribing the fusion $q_\sigma \otimes m_1$ is the supervector space with even generator
\begin{align}
\fld_{q_\sigma\tp m_1}^{q_\sigma}(Y; \text{even}) = \left\langle \PantsPAP \; +\;  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \PantsPAsP \right \rangle
\end{align}
and odd generator
\begin{align}
\fld_{q_\sigma\tp m_1}^{q_\sigma}(Y;  \text{odd}) = \left\langle \PantsPsdAP \; +\;  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \PantsPsdAsP \right \rangle
\end{align}
\dave{add note about moving dot from top leg to bottom.}
and the fusion rule is $q_\sigma \otimes m_1 = q_\sigma$.
Similarly the supervector space $\fld_{q_\sigma \tp m_\psi}(Y)$ has one even generator
\begin{align}
\fld_{q_\sigma\tp m_\psi}(Y) = \left\langle \PantsPAP \; - \; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \PantsPAsP \right \rangle
\end{align}
and the analgous odd generator
and therefore $q_\sigma \tp m_\psi = q_\sigma$.
\dave{Fix to include odd generators as well in rest of section.}
A more nontrivial example is to consider the tensor product of two $q_\sigma$ idempotents.
This again has no charge, but the resulting tube can have either flux, 
\begin{align}
\fld_{q_\sigma\tp q_\sigma}(Y) &= \left\langle \PantsPPA \; +\;  \PantsPPAs \right \rangle\\
&= \left\langle \PantsPPA  + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \PantsPPAs \right \rangle \bigoplus \left\langle \PantsPPA  - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \PantsPPAs \right \rangle
\end{align}
where in the second line we have decomposed the first line into pants that are invariant under application of $m_1$ and $m_\psi$. 
This demonstrates the fusion rule $q_\sigma \tp q_\sigma = m_1 \oplus m_\psi$. 
Slightly more non-trivial fusion rules follows from $m_\sigma^{\pm} \tp m_\psi$ and $m_\sigma^{\pm} \tp m_\psi$. 
The idempotent $m_\psi$ is purely flux, and so the pants can only have pure flux degrees of freedom on the leg matching the $m_\psi$ idempotent. $m_\sigma^{\pm}$ also has charge. 
Hence the idempotent resulting from from fusion will also have charge and again have anti periodic boundary conditions.
One finds that the $m_\sigma$ idempotent can be slipped up the pair of pants with the expense of introducing a $\sigma$ line around the other leg,
\begin{align}
\PantsAstAAs  = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \;  \PantsAsAshAsvt
\end{align}
Now one can check that $m_\psi$ is an eigenstate of the closed sigma loop with eigenvalue $-\sqrt{2}$ and $m_1$ is an eigenstate with eigenvalue $+\sqrt{2}$. Hence one finds that $m_\sigma^{\pm} \tp m_\psi  = m_\sigma^{\mp} \cong m_\sigma^\pm$ and $m_\sigma^{\pm} \tp m_1 = m_\sigma^{\pm}$. 
Hence we can write, for example,
\begin{align}
\fld_{m_\sigma^{\pm} \tp m_\psi}^{m_\sigma^{\mp}}(Y) = \left\langle \PantsAsAAs -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\PantsAsAshAs \pm \PantsAstAAs  \mp \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \PantsAstAshAs   \right \rangle
\end{align}
Since the $m_\sigma^{+}$ is isomorphic to to $m_\sigma^-$ we can always choose to work with either $m_\sigma^+$ or $m_\sigma^-$. In this case we can write,
\begin{align}
\fld_{m_\sigma^{+} \tp m_\psi}^{m_\sigma^{+}}({}^AY_A^A, \text{odd}) = \left\langle \PantssvXsvd -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\Pantssvtshsvd + \PantssvtXsvd  - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \Pantssvshsvd   \right \rangle 
\end{align}

The trickiest is $m_\sigma^\pm \tp m_{\sigma}^\pm$. For these we have, 
\begin{align}
\text{\dave{some pants}} &=      \Pantssvtsvtsh
\Pantssvtsvsh
\Pantssvsvtsh

\end{align}
and the odd ones are given by putting a single dot on the upper left leg.

By using this approach, it is straightforward to write down the table of fusion rules in the theory, which we present in Table \ref{fusiontable}.

\section{Braiding data}

 
\subsection{$R$-matrices}
In this subsection we provide a table of the $R$ symbols in the theory. First, we need to set some conventions on our fusion spaces. We will work on the three-punctured sphere rather than drawing out pairs of pants, as it is much easier to perform calculations using the three-punctured sphere picture. 

We will write a generic even fusion space, which is an even vector in the fusion space $V^{ab}_c$, as 
\be \label{pants_braiding_basis} \includegraphics{pants_braiding_basis.pdf},\ee
where $a,b,c\in \mcz(C_2)$ and $u,v,w\in \zt$ are variables indicating whether or not a $\beta$ line is present on the given link. The idempotent labels represent a collection of pictures, one for each tube in their definition. For example, 
\be \includegraphics{msig_def.pdf} \ee

We will calculate the braiding in the fusion space $V^{ab}_c$ by moving the $a$ and $b$ punctures around one other and re-expressing the result in terms of the basis vectors in $V^{ba}_c$. When braiding $q$-type particles, we enforce their periodic boundary conditions graphically by introducing branch cuts ending on each $q$-type puncture, with the rule that dots sliding past a branch cut pick up a phase of $-1$. For concreteness, we will draw our branch cuts to always meet near the center of the three punctures. For example, to calculate $R^{q_\psi q_{1/\psi}}_{m_{\psi/1}}$, we write
\be \includegraphics{qpsiq1psi_braiding} \ee
where the dashed blue lines are the branch cuts, and we have taken advantage of our knowledge of the eigenvalue of $q_\psi$ under the twisted tube (i.e. the spin of $q_\psi$). 

We define odd vectors in $V^{a,b}_c$ by placing dots on the top left leg of the pants, on the leg marked $u$ in \eqref{pants_braiding_basis}. If this is impossible (e.g. if the top left leg is an $m_\psi$ idempotent), we put the dot on the top right leg of the pants, marked $v$ in \eqref{pants_braiding_basis}. For example, we can calculate the $R$-symbol $R^{m_\psi m_\sigma^+}_{m_\sigma^+} = -1$ by
\be \includegraphics{mpsimsig_braiding.pdf}.\ee
A slightly more complicated example is the odd fusion channel in $R^{q_\psi q_{1/\psi}}_{m_{\psi/1}}$:
\be \includegraphics{qpsiq1psidot_braiding.pdf} \ee
Note that we have assumed we can ``pivot'' branch cuts around the punctures on which they are located, provided that we pick up a factor of $-1$ each time the branch cut crosses a fermion. 

We have to remember to always move the dots back to the left side of the pants after the braid takes place, if possible. As an example, we can calculate the braiding of the odd fusion channel in $R^{q_\sigma q_{1/\psi}}_{m_\sigma^+}$:
\be \includegraphics{qsigq1psidot_braiding.pdf} \ee


Manipulations like these can be used to work out the full table of $R$-symbols, which we present in Table \ref{Rtable}. The $\bullet$ symbol is used to denote odd fusion channels, i.e. the action of the braiding operation on an odd vector in the fusion space $V^{ab}_c$.

\caption{\label{Rtable} The R-symbols for the $C_2$ theory. The particle labels in each entry denote fusion channels, with the bullets signifying which fusion channels are odd.

For convenience, we have defined 
\be \zeta := e^{-i\pi/8} = \theta_{m_\sigma^+}.\ee
If we switched the choice for $A^4$ (e.g. from $i$ to $-i$), we could obtain the switched $R$-symbols by sending $\zeta \mapsto \zeta^*$. 

\subsection{Modular matrices}

\subsubsection{Twists and the $T$ matrix}
There are three ways to compute the twist: by statistics (braiding two identical idempotents around one another), by spin (applying Dehn twists on the idempotents), and by modular transformations (by performing Dehn twists on the torus). 

We'll start by computing the twists by statistics, namely by tracing out the $R$ symbols. 
First for the $m$ sector:
\be \theta_{m_\unit} = 1,\ \theta_{m_\psi} = 1,\ \theta_{m^\pm_\sigma} = \pm e^{-i\pi/8}.\ee
Now for the $q$ sector:
\be \theta_{q_\unit} = e^{i\pi/8},\ \theta_{q_\psi} = -e^{i\pi/8},\ \theta_{q_\sigma} = 1,\ee

Now we will compute the spins of the idempotents by Dehn-twisting each of their tubes. This can be done by looking at the tube algebra multiplication tables for each of the periodic and anti-periodic sectors. 
For the anti-periodic sector, we obtain 
\be \theta_{m_\unit} = 1,\ \theta_{m_\psi} = 1,\ \theta_{m^\pm_\sigma} = \pm e^{-i\pi/8}.\ee
For the periodic (vortex) sector, we obtain 
\be \theta_{q_\unit} = e^{i\pi/8},\ \theta_{q_\psi} = -e^{i\pi/8},\ \theta_{q_\sigma} = 1.\ee
Note that the $T$-matrix in the vortex sector decomposes as 
\be T_P = T_{p+ip} \tp T_{\text{Ising}^{\nu = -1}},\ee
agreeing with previous results which computed the modular transformations on the periodic-periodic torus, and hinting at the existence of a secret $p+ip$ superconductor in the vortex sector. 

In the expressions above, the twists of every non-vortex $m$-type particle are ambiguous up to a factor of $\pm1$, corresponding to an ambiguity in the parity of physical fermions (boxes) attached to the tubes at the time of twisting. In this picture, the $q$-type particles have no such ambiguity, since moving an extra physical fermion around a periodic tube incurs no $-1$ sign as a result.  
If we believe that the philosophy behind the expression for chiral central charge familiar from the bosonic case goes through unchanged in the superfusion case, we should have $c_-=0$ for this theory, since we can realize this phase in a lattice model. This is sort of trivially true for the non-vortex sector, since the twists being only defined up to $\pm1$ mean that the sum over twists ``averages out'' and becomes zero. The constraint on $c_-=0$ is a nontrivial constraint for the vortex sector though, since the twists there are fully determined. Of course, by looking at the list of twists, we see that the vortex sector is indeed non-chiral. Physically, there are hints that the $c_-=-1/2$ of the Ising theory (which would be $c_- = 1/2$ if we chose $A^4=-i$) is cancelled by the $c_-=1/2$ of a background $p+ip$ superconductor that came along with the fermions we added to equip the theory with a spin structure. 

\subsubsection{Topological $S$-matrix}

Having obtained the $R$ symbols, we can now go ahead and calculate the $S$-matrix. To do this, we will use the following quantum dimensions: 
\be d_{m_1} = d_{m_\psi} = 1,\quad d_{m_\sigma^+} = d_{q_1} = d_{q_\psi} = \sqrt{2},\quad d_{q_\sigma} = 2,\ee
which gives $\mcd = \sqrt{12}$. 

There are several ways to calculate $S$. For all of them, we should keep in mind that although there are some $\pm1$ ambiguities in $T$, such ambiguities should not be present in $S$, since fermions have trivial double-braiding with one another. That is, mapping $m_a \mapsto fm_a$ where $a\in \{\unit,\psi,\sigma\}$ and $f$ is a physical fermion should not affect the answer we get for the $S$-matrix. In what follows we will calculate the $S$-matrix in several different ways, and then use a handful of different arguments to figure out what each calculation means. 

First, we can calculate $S$ by tracing out the $R$-symbols, using the formula
\be S_{ab} = \frac{1}{\mcd}\sum_{c}d_c{\rm Tr}[R^{ab}_cR^{ba}_c],\ee
which continues to hold in the fermionic setting. 
\be 
 S^{Tr} = \frac{1}{\mcd} \begin{pmatrix} 
1&\sqrt{2}&1&2\sqrt{2}&4&2\sqrt{2} \\
 \sqrt{2}&0&-\sqrt{2}&4&0&-4 \\ 
 1&-\sqrt{2}&1&-2\sqrt{2}&4&-2\sqrt{2} \\ 
 2\sqrt{2}&4& -2\sqrt{2}&0&0&0 \\ 
 4&0&4&0&0&0 \\ 
  2\sqrt{2}&-4&- 2\sqrt{2}&0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \ee
 which is modular. The block of zeros in the bottom right isn't a disaster---indeed, we might expect something like this for physical reasons, since braiding a $q$-type particle through a $q$-type loop could potentially change the $q$-loop's fermion parity, preventing it from fusing to the vacuum and evaluating to a tadpole diagram (this is the same reason that $S_{\sigma\sigma} = 0$ in the regular Ising theory).  

Instead of tracing the $R$ matrices, we can appeal to a formula relating the $S$ matrix to the topological twists. In bosonic theories, we have 
\be \label{stwist_bosonic} S_{ab} = \frac{1}{\mcd} \sum_c d_c N^{ab}_c \frac{\theta_c}{\theta_a\theta_b}.\ee
This needs to be modified in the superfusion case. By looking at the derivation of \eqref{stwist_bosonic}, we see that it involves passing vectors in the fusion space $\fld^{a,b}_c$ under a $c$ tube, and then over both an $a$ tube and over a $b$ tube. When the braiding process is embedded in $S^3$, the branch cuts become branch sheets, and so passing an odd vector in $\fld^{a,b}_c$ under a $q$-type idempotent gives a phase factor of $-1$ (we could also choose this to be obtained when passing over a $q$-type idempotent). Additionally, vectors in $\fld^{a,b}_c$ are transported in a loop during the derivation of \eqref{stwist_bosonic}, which contributes a sign of $-1$ if the vector is odd. We need to modify the previous relation to take into account both these effects, and so the correct expression for $S^{Tr}$ in the fermionic setting is 
\be S^{Tr}_{ab} = \frac{1}{\mcd} \sum_c \sum_{v \in \fld^{a,b}_c} d_c (-1)^{|v| (|c|+1)}   \frac{\theta_c}{\theta_a\theta_b},\ee
where $|v| \in \{0,1\}$ is the parity of the vector $v$ and $|c| = 1$ $(|c|=0)$ if $c$ is $q$-type ($m$-type). Note that the factor of $(-1)^{|v||c|}$ will only contribute for braids between $m$-type and $q$-type particles. 

\begin{comment}
There is a slight technicality here, since our formula for $S$ depends on our choice of twists for the $m$-type particles, even though we argued that the $S$ matrix should not suffer from the $\pm$ ambiguities that $T$ possesses. This means that the expression must be further modified so as to be invariant under fusing physical fermions onto $m$-type particles. This is done by writing 
\be S^{Tr}_{ab} = \frac{1}{\mcd} \sum_c \sum_{v \in \fld^{a,b}_c} d_c (-1)^{|v| (|c| + 1) + f(a,b,c)}   \frac{\theta_c}{\theta_a\theta_b},\ee
where $f(a,b,c)$ measures the number of {\it physical} fermions attached to any $m$-type particles in $a$, $b$ and $c$. For example, if we were to choose $\theta_{m_\unit} = 1, \theta_{m_\psi} = -1,\theta_{m^+_\sigma} = e^{-i\pi/8}$ (e.g, if we chose $\psi$ to come with a single physical fermion attached to it), we would have 
\be {f(a,b,c)} = \delta_{a,m_\psi} + \delta_{b,m_\psi} + \delta_{c,m_\psi}.\ee
The simplest convention is probably to take $m_\unit$ and $m_\psi$ to be bosonic and to use $m_\sigma^+$ as our representative for the $m_\sigma$ isomorphism class, which we have been doing throughout and will continue to do. However, we might also want to take $m_\psi$ to be fermionic, to jive with the Ising theory better. In any case, $S$ is at least independent of this choice. 
\end{comment}

\subsubsection{Ground states on tori}

By drawing pictures, it's easy to see that spin structures uniquely determine the fermion parity of any given string-net picture drawn on the torus. We would then expect that each of the four tori would carry four degenerate ground states, since $|H_1(T^2)|=4$. However, for each spin structure one of these states will turn out to not lie in the ground state manifold, meaning that there will only be three degenerate ground states for each choice of spin structure. 

We now write down the degenerate ground states for each spin structure on the torus. For the $(A,A)$ sector, we have the three states 
\be GS_{(A,A)} = \FubeXXX,\ \FubeXss,\ \FubesXs.\ee
For periodic boundary conditions around the longitudinal cycle (the shorter cycle, horizontal in our pictures), we have 
\be GS_{(P,A)} = \FubeXXX,\ \FubeXss,\ \FubessX.\ee
For periodic boundary conditions around the meridional cycle (the big cycle, vertical in our pictures), we have 
\be GS_{(A,P)} = \FubeXXX,\ \FubesXs,\ \FubessX,\ee
and for periodic boundary conditions around both cycles, we get 
\be GS_{(P,P)} = \FubesdXs,\ \FubeXsds,\ \FubessdX.\ee 
Notice that all of the tubes on the $(P,P)$ torus are odd. This is more evidence for the presence of a background $p+ip$ superconductor, since a $p+ip$ superconductor always has odd fermion parity when placed on a $(P,P)$ torus. 

%Also note that on every torus, there is one additional non-zero picture which lies at higher energy, which can be obtained by drawing the configuration of $\Sigma$ lines not present in the given collection of three pictures, adding on a dot, and creating a massive fermionic excitation somewhere in the background\dave{Not higher energy, but the state is equal to zero.}. For the $(P,P)$ torus, this high-energy state is the empty picture with a massive fermionic excitation (will elaborate later). 

Having three ground states for each spin structure means that we have 12 ground states across all spin structures. How can we relate this to the fact that $|\mcz(C_2)| = 6$? The idea is that the number of ground states is captured by tracing the identity functor on $\mcz(C_2)$, where the identity functor is
\be {\rm id} = \bigoplus_{a\in\mcz(C_2)} a,\ee
since the direct sum of a complete collection of primitive idempotents maps everything to itself. When we say ``trace out the identity functor'', we mean crossing the tubes in id with an $S^1$ so that they form a collection of tori, embedding them in $S^3$, and evaluating the resulting configuration by filling in the complement of the tubes with a TV state-sum with fixed boundary conditions. Filling in the complement of the tubes with a TV state-sum can only be done if we choose a spin structure on the timelike $S^1$ that can be smoothly extended to a spin structure on a disk, which means that we must choose anti-periodic boundary conditions for the timelike $S^1$. Therefore, only half of the ground states on the collection of tori will come from tracing out id. The rest (on tori with periodic boundary conditions around the meridional cycle) come from tracing out some sort of twisted id functor, which has a $\pi$ flux inserted through the cycle of the $S^1$. 

%These arguments make the case for using anti-periodic boundary conditions on the timelike $S^1$ when calculating the twists and braids of the idempotents through the $R$-symbols. All that's left is to decide whether this means we should use the trace or supertrace. At this moment in time, all signs seem to point to the trace being associated with antiperiodic boundary conditions. This is for two reasons. First, we can observe that the using the supertrace to calculate the $S$ matrix in the $qq$ braiding sector gives us something (almost) proportional to $\zeta^2$ (the fact that $S_{q_\sigma q_\sigma}$ isn't may not be a problem), while using the trace gives us a $qq$ $S$-matrix of $0$. We know that we should have $S^4 = -1$ when acting on the ground states of a $(P,P)$ torus, which suggests that the supertrace is what we want to use to compute $S$ for the $(P,P)$ torus. Thus, the supertrace should be associated with periodic boundary conditions along the timelike $S^1$, leaving the trace to be associated with anti-periodic boundary conditions along the timelike $S^1$. 



We are now in a position to give a more compelling argument for why the $qq$ braiding sector of $S^{Tr}$ is $0_{3\times 3}$. Since each $q$-type idempotent is associated with a torus with $(P,A)$ spin structure (periodic around the spatial $S^1$, anti-periodic around the timelike $S^1$), a double-braid between two $q$-type particles looks like: 
\be \includegraphics{linked_qtori.pdf}\ee
When we compute this partition function, we thicken the two tori so that their boundaries become glued with one another, forming a torus dividing the ambient $S^3$ into two solid tori. However, we see that the above choice of spin structures makes this gluing process impossible, since the spin structures on the two linked tori do not agree when one another when the tori are glued. More precisely, we see that the boundary conditions on the meridional cycle of one linked torus must match the longitudinal boundary conditions of the other in order for the gluing procedure to be well-defined, which is not the case in the above figure. This means that the partition function of a linking of two $q$-type idempotents must be zero, which explains the block of zeros in $S^{Tr}$.

\subsubsection{Modular transformations}

In this section, we'll switch to using $A$ in equations rather than just implicitly working with $A^4=i$. Since $d = -A^2 - A^{-2}$, in order to have $d=\sqrt{2}$ we will pick $A = ie^{i\pi/8}$. Also, to make the notation a bit more compact, we will define 
\be e := \FubeXXX,\quad h := \FubesXs,\quad v := \FubeXss,\quad t:= \FubessX,\ee
with the spin structures of the tubes left to be understood in context. As a reminder, we are using the label $(X,Y)$ to denote the spin structure on $T^2$ with boundary condition $X$ along the spatial $S^1$ and boundary condition $Y$ along the timelike $S^1$ (so that e.g. the $q$-type idempotents are associated with $(P,A)$). This is a bit backwards, depending on how you look at it---might change it later. 

\underline{$\mathbf{(P,P)}$:} First, we'll look at the $(P,P)$ torus, whose spin structure is preserved under both $S$ and $T$. The three vectors in the basis of ground states are $v_\bullet,h_\bullet,$ and $t_\bullet$,
where the $\bullet$s in labels mean that their associated tubes have odd fermion parity (the $h_\bullet$ tube has a $\beta$ string wrapping around its diameter). 
In the ground state basis $(v_\bullet,h_\bullet,t_\bullet)^T$, we see that 
\be S^{gs}_{PP} = \begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 & 0 \\ A^4 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & A^{-6} \end{pmatrix},\quad T^{gs}_{PP} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & A^{-6} \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\ee
One can check that $(ST)^3 = S^4= -\unit_{3\times3}$. Note that $S^{-1} = A^4 S$ (schematically, since the difference between the two is a $\pi$ rotation in framing), so the $S$ matrix is not self-dual as it is for bosonic theories. Also, as a sanity check we see that the eigenvalues of $T$ are $1,\pm A^{-3}$ (if $A^4=i$, then $A^{-3} = e^{i\pi/8}$).

To transform these matrices into the idempotent basis in which $T$ is diagonalized, we take 
\be S \mapsto V^{-1}SV,\ T\mapsto V^{-1}TV,\ee 
where in this case $V$ is the matrix mapping the basis $(q_{\unit\bullet},q_{\sigma\bullet},q_{\psi\bullet})^T$ to the ground state basis $(v_\bullet,h_\bullet,t_\bullet)^T$. Note that none of $q_{\unit\bullet},q_{\sigma\bullet},q_{\psi\bullet}$ are idempotents in the strict sense of the word, since they multiply together to give even tubes. To ensure they are normalized correctly, we require that they square to their associated even idempotents:
\be q_{\unit\bullet}^2 = q_\unit,\quad q_{\psi\bullet}^2 = q_\psi,\quad q_{\sigma\bullet}^2 = q_\sigma.\ee
In order for this to hold, we see that we need to take
\be q_{\unit\bullet} = \frac{A^{-2}}{2}(v_\bullet + A^3 t_\bullet),\quad q_{\psi\bullet} = \frac{A^{-2}}{2}(v_\bullet - A^3t_\bullet),\quad q_{\sigma\bullet} = \frac{1}{d}h_\bullet.\ee
Therefore, the matrix that maps the basis $(q_{\unit\bullet},q_{\sigma\bullet},q_{\psi\bullet})^T$ to the ground state basis $(v_\bullet,h_\bullet,t_\bullet)^T$ is 
\be V_{PP} = \begin{pmatrix} A^{-2}/2 & 0 & A^{-2}/2 \\ 0 & 1/d & 0 \\ A/2 & 0 & -A/2 \end{pmatrix}.\ee
This gives 
\be S_{PP} = \frac{A^2}{2} \begin{pmatrix} -1 & d & 1 \\ d & 0 & d \\ 1 & d & -1 \end{pmatrix},\quad T_{PP} = \begin{pmatrix} A^{-3} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0& 0& -A^{-3}.\end{pmatrix}.\ee
The prefactor of $A^2$ in $S_{PP}$ takes care of the $S^4=-\unit$ constraint for us. 
\ethan{There are some hints that would lead us to expect an $A^{-2}$ in front of $S$ instead.}

\underline{$\mathbf{(A,A)}$:} For the $(A,A)$ spin structure, we see that the $S$-matrix in the ground state basis $(e,v,h)^T$ is $S^{gs}_{(A,A)} = 1\oplus \sigma^x$. The matrix transforming from the idempotent basis $(m_\unit,m_\sigma^+,m_\psi)^T$ to the ground state basis is 
\be V_{AA}= \frac{1}{2}\begin{pmatrix}1&0&1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0\\ 1/d & 0 & -1/d \end{pmatrix},\ee
and so we obtain
\be S_{AA} = \frac{1}{2}\begin{pmatrix} 1 & d & 1 \\ d & 0 & -d \\ 1 & -d & 1 \end{pmatrix} = S_{Ising}.\ee

The $T$-matrix does not preserve the spin structure, as it sends $T : (A,A) \mapsto (A,P)$. As a map between the ground state bases $(e,v,h)^T_{AA}$ and $(e,t,h)_{AP}^T$, we have the convenient  
\be T_{AA\mapsto AP}^{gs} = \unit_{3\times 3}.\ee
The matrix mapping the idempotent basis $(m_\unit,m_\sigma^+,m_\psi)^T_{AP}$ onto the ground state basis $(e,t,h)_{AP}^T$  is
\be V_{AP} = \frac{1}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & A^{-3} & 0 \\ 1/d & 0 & -1/d \end{pmatrix},\ee
which tells us that 
\be T_{AA\mapsto AP} = V_{AP}^{-1} T_{AA\mapsto AP}^{gs} V_{AA} =  \begin{pmatrix}
1 &0&0 \\ 0&A^3&0\\0&0&1
\end{pmatrix}.\ee


\underline{$\mathbf{(P,A)}$:} Now for the $(P,A)$ spin structure, which is preserved by $T$ (as the $q$-type quasiparticles have well-defined self-statistics). First for the $S$-matrix, which maps the $PA$ spin structure to the $AP$ spin structure. As a map between the ground state basis $(e,v,t)_{PA}^T$ and the ground state basis $(e,t,h)_{AP}^T$, the $S$ matrix is
\be S^{gs}_{PA\mapsto AP} = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0& 0 \\ 0 & 0 & A^{-6} \\ 0&1& 0
\end{pmatrix}.\ee
The matrix that maps the idempotent basis $(q_\unit,q_\sigma,q_\psi)^T$ onto the ground state basis $(e,v,t)_{PA}^T$ is 
\be V_{PA} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 \\ 1/2 & 0 & 1/2 \\ A^3/2 & 0 & -A^3/2
\end{pmatrix},\ee
This means that in the idempotent basis, the $S$ matrix is 
\be S_{PA \mapsto AP} = V_{AP}^{-1} S^{top}_{PA \mapsto AP} V_{PA} = \begin{pmatrix}
d/2 & 1 & d/2 \\ 1 & 0 & -1 \\ -d/2 & 1 & -d/2
\end{pmatrix}.\ee

Now for $T$, which preserves the spin structure. In the ground state basis basis $(e,v,t)^T$, $T$ takes the form 
\be T^{gs}_{PA} = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & A^{-6} \\ 0&1&0 
\end{pmatrix}\ee
which tells us that in the idempotent basis, 
\be T_{PA}  = \begin{pmatrix}
A^{-3} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -A^{-3}
\end{pmatrix}\ee

\underline{$\mathbf{(A,P)}$:} Finally, we turn to the $(A,P)$ spin structure. 
Since the $S$-matrix must be symmetric, we can immediately write 
\be S_{AP \mapsto PA} =  S_{AP \mapsto PA}^T = \begin{pmatrix}
d/2 & 1 & -d/2 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\ d/2 & -1 & -d/2
\end{pmatrix}.\ee
As a map between the ground state bases $(e,t,h)^T_{AP}$ and $(e,v,h)^T_{AA}$, $T$ is 
\be T^{gs}_{AP \mapsto AA} = \begin{pmatrix}
1 &0&0 \\ 0&A^6 &0\\0&0&1
\end{pmatrix}.\ee
Therefore, in the idempotent basis, 
\be T_{AP\mapsto AA} = V_{AA}^{-1} T^{gs}_{AP\mapsto AA} V_{AP} = \begin{pmatrix}
1 &0&0 \\ 0&A^3&0\\0&0&1
\end{pmatrix}.\ee

\section{Fusion category review}
\ethan{I don't think we really need this in the paper. It isn't anything original, and we're not going to do a better job of explaining things than any of the other reviews of this stuff that are out there (e.g. Kitaev) --- we should just refer readers to them (and all of our readers will likely know this stuff anyway). Given that we introduce the F-symbols and pivotal stuff and everything in the superfusion case anyway, it also seems redundant to do them here as well --- we can always obtain the stuff in this section as a special case of the stuff in the superfusion section if we like. }

In this section we give a brief review of fusion categories. 
%Physically one can think of the diagrams as the world lines of ``particles" in a $1+1$ dimensional theory.
%For example this could be considered as the topological theory associated to a gapped boundary of a $2+1$ dimensional topological phase. 
must add:

- identity object

- duality axiom

- normalizations/quantum dimensions

- inner product

A fusion category {\cal C} is a collection of data; a list of simple objects $\{a, b, \cdots, \}$, fusion rules $N_{ab}^c$, and F-symbols. 
Physically we think of a simple object as the collection of states which is invariant under local operations. 
More formally we would say that the space of maps from $a$ to it'self is just a complex number times the identity\begin{align}
\text{End}(a,a) \cong \mathbb{C} \text{id}_a.
\end{align}
This is the definition of a {\em simple object} in a fusion category {\cal C}. 
One could consider objects that aren't simple, but we require that such an object always decomposes into a direct sum of simple objects, for example, $A = \oplus_i x_i$, where each $x_i$ is simple. 
In this case we have $\text{Hom}(A,A)= \oplus_i \text{Hom}(x_i,x_i)$ (picture). 
This is the definition of {\em semisimple}, which says that each object can always be decomposed into a finite sum of simple objects.

Diagrammatically we represent this space as a set of labeled points on a circle or line. (picture).
Physically these particles should be thought of as local excitations which are well separated.
The ``time evolution" maps this set of states to another on a circle or a line (picture). 
During time evolution two neighbouring particles may be brought together and can fuse.
Such a process is called fusion and given the semi-simplicity condition, we know that the result can be split into a direct sum of particles.
We will label the fusion space that takes $a \otimes b$ to $c$ by $V_{ab}^c \cong \text{Hom}(a\otimes b, c)$. 
The dimension of this vector space is known as the fusion multiplicity $N_{ab}^c = \text{dim} V_{ab}^c$. 
We can choose a basis for this fusion space by $v_{ab; \mu}^c \in V_{ab}^c$ with $\mu = 1, \cdots, N_{ab}^c$, diagrammatically we write,
\begin{align}
v_{ab; \mu}^c = \text{(picture)}.
\end{align}
There is the adjoint space $V_{c}^{ab}$ which splits particle $c$ into particles $a$ and $b$.
The identity operator on the space $a \otimes b$ is given by 
\begin{align}
\text{id}_a \otimes \text{id}_b \cong \oplus_c V^{ab}_c \circ V^c_{ab}
\end{align}
Indeed, any evolution of particles can be decomposed in this way, 
%\begin{align}
%V_{x_1 x_2 \cdots x_r}^{y_1 y_2 \cdots y_w} = \oplus V^{y_1 y_2}_{z_1} \otimes V^{z_1 y_2}_{z_2} \otimes \cdots \otimes V^{z_{w-1} y_w}_{z_w} \circ V^{z_w}_{z_{w+1} x_r} \otimes V^{z_{w+1}}_{ z_{w+2} x_{r-1}} \otimes \cdots \otimes V^{z_{w+r-1}}_{x_1 x_2}
%\end{align}
\begin{align}
V_{x_1 x_2 \cdots}^{y_1 y_2 \cdots}  = \oplus_z V^{y1 y2}_z \circ V^{z y_3 \cdots}_{x_1 x_2 \cdots }
\end{align}
applying this rule recursively in the fusion and splitting spaces allows one to decompose the operator into fusion and splitting vectors. 

Of course this decomposition is arbitrary, we weren't forced to fuse $y_1$ and $y_2$ first, we could have equally well fused $y_2$ and $y_3$ first. 
Since the resulting vector spaces are isomorphic, we know that there has to be an isomorphism between these fusion processes. 
The isomorphism is known as the F-symbol and defines the linear map, \dave{need to add notation for tracking the spaces.}
\begin{align}
F^{abc}_d: \oplus_x V^{ab}_x \tp V^{xc}_{d} \rightarrow \oplus_y V^{ay}_d \tp V^{bc}_y
\end{align}
We will often adopt the notation for matrix elements of the F-symbol in a particular basis given by,
\begin{align}
v^{ab}_{x; \mu} \tp v^{x c}_{d; \nu} = \sum_{\sigma, y \rho} \left[ F^{abc}_d \right]_{\mu x \nu ; \sigma y \rho} v^{ay}_{d; \rho} \tp v^{bc}_{y; \sigma}
\end{align}
and diagrammatically this is written (picture).

 - The F-symbols are subject to a consistency condition known as the pentagon equation
....

The pentagon equation must be compatible with the pivotal structure. 
- Do the $F^2$ frobenius schur thing.

\section{super fusion categories}
Goal: Define super fusion categories for target audience. Target audience = physicists who have spent some time in Appendix E of Kitaev's 2006 anyon paper. \ethan{I think this should be an appendix, like in Kitaev's paper. It's definitely on the very mathematical end of the spectrum.}
\dave{Why push this off to the appendix? I thought it was one of the purposes of this paper.}

\subsection{Simple objects}
We associate objects with idempotents and simple objects with minimal idempotents.
%In an ordinary fusion category simple objects have the defining feature that there endomorphisms are given by $\mathbb{C}$.
%This is because any simple algebra over $\mathbb{C}$ is Morita equivalent to $\mathbb{C}$. \ethan{true, 
In ordinary fusion categories, the endomorphism ring of any simple object is $\cc$. This is due to Schur's lemma: if an object $x$ is simple, then any morphism in $\End(x)$ must be an isomorphism, and hence $\End(x) = \cc$. Objects with $\End(x) = \cc$ are certainly still possible in the more general fermionic setting we consider here, and we will refer to them as {\it M type} objects. 
\dave{I don't understand why this is a consequence of Schur's lemma. I thought the definition of a simple object was $\text{End}(x) = \mathbb{C}$}

As we saw in the Ising example, the endomorphisms of simple objects in fermionic theories aren't always $\mathbb{C}$, and may instead be a simple super algebra over $\mathbb{C}$. By Schur's lemma every element in $\End(x)$ is invertible if $x$ is simple, and so $\End(x)$ must be a division algebra. The only $\zz_2$-graded division algebra is the first complex Clifford algebra $\cl_1$, 
%As was the case for the image of $\sigma$ under condensation.
%All simple super algebras are Morita equivalent to the clifford algebra with one odd generator $\mathbb{C} \ell_1$\cite{wall1964}.
which is generated by two elements: $1$ and an odd generator $\Gamma$ satisfying $\Gamma^2 = 1$. Generic elements in $\cl_1$ are complex linear combinations of $1$ and $\Gamma$.
The simplest vector space representing $\cl_1$ is the super vector space $\mathbb{C}^{1|1}$.
We will refer to simple objects whose endomorphism algebra is $\cl_1$ as {\it Q type} objects.
In summary, our terminology is 
\begin{align}
\vcenter{\xymatrix @!0 @M=1mm @C=25mm{
& \text{End}(x) = \mathbb{C} \ar@{<->}[rr] &   &\text{$x$ is a simple M type object}&  \\
&\text{End}(x) = \mathbb{C} \ell_1 \ar@{<->}[rr]  &  &\text{$x$ is a simple Q type object}&
	}}
\end{align}

$$
$$
- review irreducible representations of super algebra's via \cite{jozefiak1988}??

- Duality axiom?
$$
$$



A defining feature of a simple object is the quantum dimension
\begin{align}
d_x = \text{Tr} \; x = \text{picture}
\end{align}

\subsection{Fusion spaces}

The set of input data for a super fusion category will not only constitute a list of simple objects and their types (Q or M), but also their fusion rules. 
The fusion rules can be encapsulated by integers $N_c^{ab}$ taking values in $\zz_{p+q}$, 
%\begin{align}
%N_{c}^{ab} = 0, 1, \cdots p, p+1, \cdots p+q+1
%\end{align}
where $p$ ($q$) is the number of even (odd) ways that $a$ and $b$ can fuse to $c$.
Therefore, the graded vector space assigned to fusion space of $a$ and $b$ into $c$ is $\mathbb{C}^{p|q}$:
\begin{align}
V^{ab}_c \cong \mathbb{C}^{p|q}
\end{align}
For any vector $\ket{\psi} \in V^{ab}_c$ we will denote its grading by $|\psi| \in \{ 0, 1\}$, where $0$ is even parity and $1$ is odd.
If any of the particles $a,b,c$ involved in the fusion are Q type, then there are always as many even fusion channels as odd ones, and the space is of the form $\mathbb{C}^{p|p}$.
This follows from the fact that $Q$ type particles always possess odd isomorphisms, which imply that the even and odd parts of the fusion space in question are isomorphic, and hence have the same dimension. 
\dave{Can we show $m \tp m \rightarrow q$ is not allowed? This seems plausible.}
\dave{Contrast an $m \tp m \rightarrow m$ fusion space of super dimension $(p|p)$ with a $q \tp q \rightarrow m$ fusion space of super dimension $(p|p)$.}

Because of the anti-commuting nature of super vector spaces, taking tensor products in super vector spaces requires defining an ordering of the vectors in the tensor product.
We will write $V^{ab}_{c,n}$ to designate that the vector space $V^{ab}_c$ appears as the $n$th term in a tensor product (although when we are only talking about one fusion vertex we may omit the subscript).
Depeding on the parity of the vectors involved, interchanging two indices may result in the interchange of two fermions, for which we pick up a minus sign. 
Thus, superfusion categories possess a canonical braiding structure given by the Koszul sign rule:
%\dave{Need to think about tensoring over endmorphisms, how these play together, and also when we 'extend' the vector space so that local moves implement tensoring over endomorphisms.}
%\begin{align}
%P_{12}: \; \; &V^{ab}_{c,1} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xy}_{z,2} \rightarrow V^{ab}_{c,2} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xy}_{z,1} \\
%		  & \ket{\psi}\tp_\mathbb{C} \ket{\eta}  \mapsto (-1)^{|\psi| |\eta|} \ket{\psi} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} \ket{\eta}
%\end{align}
\begin{align}
\vcenter{\xymatrix @!0 @M=1mm @C=42mm{
 &P_{12}: \; \;V^{ab}_{c,1} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xy}_{z,2} \ar[r]            & V^{ab}_{c,2} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xy}_{z,1} \\
		  &\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \ket{\psi}\tp_\mathbb{C} \ket{\eta}  \ar@{|->}[r] & (-1)^{|\psi| |\eta|} \ket{\psi} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} \ket{\eta}
	}} \quad \quad \ket{\psi} \in V^{ab}_{c} \;\; \text{and} \;\;  \ket{\eta} \in V^{xy}_{z}
\end{align}
This just says that if both $\ket{\psi}$ and $\ket{\eta}$ are odd vectors, then we pick up a factor of $-1$ when we interchange them in a tensor product. 

There is an important subtlety involved when we tensor together fusion spaces involving Q type particles to form fusion diagrams. To see where this comes from, suppose $x$ is a Q type particle, and consider the resolution of the identity 
\begin{align} \label{resid}
\Hom(x,x) \cong \bigoplus_y \Hom(x,y) \tp_\cc \Hom(y,x).
\end{align}
The above relation is actually {\it incorrect}, since if $x$ is simple then this reads $\Hom(x,x) = \Hom(x,x) \tp_\cc \Hom(x,x)$, which since $\End(x) = \cl_1$ implies $\cl_1 \cong \cl_1\tp \cl_1 \cong \cl_2$, a contradiction. In order to fix this, we need to mod out by ``internal'' degrees of freedom carried by Q type particles. 

Graphically, modding out by these internal degrees of freedom is equivalent to modding out by local 
involving Q type particles. 
These relations are given by locally creating pairs of fermions and by sliding fermions from one fusion vertex to another:
 \begin{align}
\LocalRelationUp \sim \LocalRelationDown \quad \quad  \LocalRelationLeft \sim \LocalRelationRight.
\label{FusionSpaceRelation}
 \end{align}
Since the first equivalence relation can be derived from the second, and vice versa, both relations define the same equivalence class on the fusion space.
A tensor product taken over a Q type particle must be quotiented by isomorphisms like this. Explicitly, 
\be \ba
 &V^{ab}_{x,1} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xc}_{d,2}\quad  \text{is replaced by} \quad V^{ab}_{x,1} \tp_{\text{End}(x)} V^{xc}_{d,2}, \text{ and} \\ 
  &V^{ax}_{c,1} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{bc}_{x,2}\quad  \text{is replaced by} \quad V^{ax}_{b,1} \tp_{\text{End}(x)} V^{bc}_{x,2},
\ea 
\ee
where $\tp_{\End(x)}$ means that $\End(x)$ is taken to be the tensor unit. Explicitly, 
%\begin{align}
%V^{ab}_{x,1} \tp_{\text{End}(x)} V^{xc}_{d,1} \equiv V^{ab}_{x,2} \tp_{\mathbb{C}}V^{xc}_{d,1}/\langle (V^{ab}_{x,2} \circ f_3) \tp_{\mathbb{C}}V^{xc}_{d,1} \sim V^{ab}_{x,2} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} (f_3\circ V^{xc}_{d,1}) \rangle
%\label{qtensor}
%\end{align}
\begin{align}
V^{ab}_{x,1} \tp_{\text{End}(x)} V^{xc}_{d,2} = V^{ab}_{x,1} \tp_{\mathbb{C}}V^{xc}_{d,2}/ \sim,
\label{qtensor}
\end{align}
where $\sim$ is the equivalence relation 
\begin{align} \label{equivreln}
(V^{ab}_{x,1} f_3) \tp_{\mathbb{C}}V^{xc}_{d,2} \sim V^{ab}_{x,1} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} (f_3 V^{xc}_{d,2})
\end{align}
for all $f \in \text{End}(x)$. \ethan{I just used multiplicative notation, which seems fine to me since the $f_i$s are just multiplication by numbers.} Likewise, we have $V^{ax}_d \tp_{\End(x)} V^{bc}_x = V^{ax}_d \tp_\cc V^{bc}_x / \sim$, where $\sim$ is the equivalence relation $(V^{ax}_{d,1} f_3) \tp_{\mathbb{C}}V^{bc}_{x,2} \sim V^{ax}_{d,1} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} (f_3 V^{bc}_{x,2})$ for all $f\in \End(x)$. 

Quotienting by the local relations in (\ref{FusionSpaceRelation}) is reminiscent of superconductivity. 
Indeed the relation says that pairs of fermions can be freely created and removed as well as hopped along Q type edges. 
A fermionic phase of matter will generate such terms are at second order in perturbation theory by proximity coupling a superconductor.
Thus, heuristically, we can think of Q type particles as the result of proximity induced superconductivity on a super fusion category with only M type particles.

Using the modified tensor product allows us write down the correct version of \eqref{resid}, which is 
\begin{align}
\Hom(x,x) \cong \bigoplus_y \Hom(x,y) \tp_{\End(y)} \Hom(y,x).
\end{align}
In particular, if $x$ is a simple Q type object, then we (correctly) have $\cl_1 \cong \Hom(x,x) \cong \Hom(x,x)\tp_{\End(x)} \Hom(x,x) \cong \cl_1\tp_{\cl_1}\cl_1 \cong \cl_1$.  
%This is idea is very important in the general theory of superfusion categories, and so we devote the next section to examining its consequences in more detail. 

%\subsection{Tensor product}
%In this section we elaborate on taking tensor products in superfusion categories. 
%For M type particles, the tensor product is taken over $\mathbb{C}$, as usual. 

%As mentioned above, this is not the case for tensor products involving Q type particles. In general, we need to quotient out by endomorphism rings when taking tensor products, as in \eqref{qtensor}.

To take the quotient in \eqref{qtensor} explicitly (which we must do when performing calculations numerically), we impose the condition that physical vectors in the space $V^{ab}_x \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xc}_d$ be left invariant under the action of $\text{End}(x)$. 
%For a Q type particle $x$, we have $\End(x) \cong \cl_1$. Each of the two generators of $\cl_1$ results in an isomorphism of the fusion spaces defined by
There are two types of fusion diagrams we need to consider, depending how the fusion vertices that they are formed from are connected. This leads to two isomorphisms of fusion diagrams:
\begin{align}
&\vcenter{\xymatrix @!0 @M=1mm @C=42mm{
 &L_f: \; \;V^{ab}_{x} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xc}_{d} \ar[r]            & V^{ab}_{x} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xc}_{d}  \\
		  &\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \ket{\psi}\tp_\mathbb{C} \ket{\eta}  \ar@{|->}[r] & (f\ket{\psi}) \tp_{\mathbb{C}} (f^{-1} \ket{\eta})  
		  }} \quad \quad f \in \text{End}(x)\\
		  \\		  
&		  \vcenter{\xymatrix @!0 @M=1mm @C=42mm{
		  &R_f: \; \;V^{ay}_{d} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{bc}_{y} \ar[r]            & V^{ay}_{d} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{bc}_{y} \\
		  &\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \ket{\psi}\tp_\mathbb{C} \ket{\eta}  \ar@{|->}[r] & (f\ket{\psi}) \tp_{\mathbb{C}} (f^{-1} \ket{\eta})
	}}	\quad \quad f \in \text{End}(y)
	\end{align}
Importantly, we note that both $L_f$ and $R_f$ are always {\it even} maps, regardless of the parity of $f$. 

Tensoring over endomorphisms in a fusion space is equivalent to requiring the fusion space to be invariant under the action of $L_f$ and $R_f$. 
Said another way, any vectors related by application of $L_f$ or $R_f$ are considered equivalent, which makes it natural to think of $L_f$ and $R_f$ gauge transformations, since they encode redundancy in physical vector spaces.

It is often useful to do calculations %in the ``extended" vector space, i.e., where we compute with 
by working with explicit choices of representatives of vectors in each isomorphism class, imposing the requirement that any diagrammatic manipulation commutes with all endomorphisms generated by $L_f$ and $R_f$. 
After doing calculations, we can project back onto the physical subspace by modding out by the equivalence relation \eqref{equivreln}. 
This can be done provided that $L_f$ and $R_f$ commute on any fusion diagram. For example, for a fusion diagram built from three fusion vertices, we require that
\begin{align}
L_{f, 32}L_{g,21} V^{ab}_{x,3} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xc}_{y,2} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{yd}_{w,1} = L_{g,21} L_{f, 32} V^{ab}_{x,3} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xc}_{y,2} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{yd}_{w,1} 
\end{align}
for all $f \in \text{End}(x)$ and $g \in \text{End}(y)$. 
In fact this is always the case, since as mentioned earlier both $L_f$ and $R_f$ are even maps. 
%Although they may have a nontrivial action on the fusion spaces.
From now, when we write $\tp$ we will always mean $\tp_\cc$, unless specified otherwise.

\subsection{F-symbols}
As usual the $F$-symbols are defined as basis transformations between different fusion spaces, although in our case we must account for our quotienting procedure in their definition. Therefore, we define the $F$-symbols as
\begin{align}
F^{abc}_d: \; \; \bigoplus_x V^{ab}_{x,2} \tp_{\text{End}(x)} V^{xc}_{d,1} \rightarrow \bigoplus_y V^{ay}_{d,1} \tp_{\text{End}(y)} V^{bc}_{y,2}
\end{align}
We require that the F-symbols commute with the gauge transformations $L,R$ that implement the tensor product over $\End(x)$, and so the following diagram must commute:
\begin{align}
	\vcenter{\xymatrix @!0 @M=1mm @R=30mm @C=42mm{
		 \bigoplus_x V^{ab}_x \otimes V^{xc}_d \ar[d]^{L_{f}}\ar[r]^{F^{abc}_d}& \bigoplus_y V^{ay}_d \otimes V^{bc}_y \ar[d]^{R_{g}} \\
		\bigoplus_x V^{ab}_x \otimes V^{xc}_d  \ar[r]^{F^{abc}_d}  & \bigoplus_y V^{ay}_d \otimes V^{bc}_y	
	}} 
	{ \quad\quad \forall f \in \oplus_x \text{End}(x), \; \; g \in \oplus_y \text{End}(y)}
	\label{Fcommute}
\end{align}
In matrix form, this means that we require 
\be
F^{abc}_d  L_f=   R_g F^{abc}_d.
\ee

As with the bosonic case, these F-symbols must obey the pentagon equation.
In the superfusion case, the pentagon relation is equivalent to the commutativity of the following diagram: \ethan{Are the Kozul signs appearing in the normal super pentagon equation begin left implicit here?}

where we have used the notation $\tp_x \equiv \tp_{\text{End}(x)}$.
The use of the modified tensor products $\tp_x$ is how (\ref{endoPentagon}) differs from the ``super pentagon" equation which, has already appeared in the literature REFXXX.

In practice, it is often easier to first solve the pentagon equation in the ``extended space'' by replacing all $\tp_x$ tensor products with $\tp$ (yielding the super pentagon equation), and then requiring the resulting $F$-symbols to satisfy the constraint (\ref{Fcommute}).

\dave{We should think about to what extent all super fusion categories can be realized by fermion condensation}

\dave{We should also ask when this process is reversible, i.e., can we ``guage" fermion parity and get back to a bosonic fusion category}

\section{Tube algebra} \label{tubeapp}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\ethan{this section will def be improved at a later point (I'll also try to trim down on all the formal baggage that we don't really need)}
In this section, we give an introduction to the tube algebra and show how its construction is modified in the fermionic setting. 

\subsubsection{Intuitive idea}

We will work on a sphere with $n$ punctures, with a quasiparticle excitation localized at the location of each puncture. Acting with the elements of the fube algebra on this manifold amounts to fusing in fubes at the location of each puncture, which adds in more space around the location of each quasiparticle and is essentially like changing how zoomed-in our view of the quasiparticles is. This means that when we fuse fubes into the manifold, we are essentially doing an ``RG flow'' on the quasiparticles -- if the quasiparticles are stable and represent well-defined topological excitations, they must be invariant under this re-scaling procedure. This means that we can always associate quasiparticles with vector spaces that are invariant under the action of the fube algebra. Finding such vector spaces is the same thing as finding the simple modules of the fube algebra, which in turn is the same thing as computing the fube algebra's central primitive idempotents. 

\subsubsection{Formal aspects}

Now we will formalize these ideas. For any manifold $M$, define the supervector space $\fld(M)$ as 
\be \fld(M) = \{\text{$\cc$-linear combinations of field configurations on $M$}\} / (\text{local relations}), \ee
where ``field configurations on $M$'' are string-net pictures drawn on $M$ with the strings labeled by the objects of the superfusion category we're working with, and the local relations consist of performing $F$-moves, removing contractible loops, and doing other operations that are allowed by the superfusion category data. Note that the super nature of $\fld(M)$ prevents us from adding together any two field configurations with different fermion parity. Also note that endomorphisms of $\fld(M)$ can always be represented by elements of $\fld(M\times [0,1])$, and so \be \fld(M\times[0,1]) \cong \fld(M)^*,\ee
where $\fld(M)^*$ is the linear dual of $\fld(M)$. For example, if $C$ is the cylinder then $\fld(C) = \fld(S^1)^*$. 

Finally, note that for us the manifold $M$ will always carry a spin structure, which induces a decomposition 
\be \fld(M) \cong \bigoplus_{\eta \in H^1(M,\zt)}\fld^\eta(M),\ee
where $\fld^\eta(M)$ denotes field configurations compatible with the spin structure determined by the cochain $\eta$. While this is good to keep in the back of our minds, spin structure dpenedence will play a rather passive role in what follows. 

If $M$ and $N$ are two manifolds and there exists a closed manifold $S$ such that $\p M \ni S \in \p N$, then $M$ and $N$ can be glued along $S$, which induces a tensor product between field configurations on $M$ and those on $N$. However, when we do the gluing, we must take care to mod out by the degrees of freedom carried by the field configurations on $S$, by using a modified tensor product:
\be \label{eq:gluing} \fld(M\cup_SN) \cong \fld(M)\tp_{\fld(S)} \fld(N).\ee
Here, the use of $\tp_{\fld(S)}$ rather than the usual $\tp_\cc$ is for the same reason as the use of $\tp_{\End(Z)}$ in the usual coproduct isomorphism, which was discussed in detail back in \S \ref{sec:ccs}. For example, if $C$ is the cylinder and we let $\fld(C;a,b)$ denote the cylinder corresponding to the map $\fld(C;a,b) : a\ra b$ for $a,b\in \fld(S^1)$, we can write a resolution of the identity in the form
\be \label{eq:tuberes} \fld(C;a,b) = \bigoplus_{c\in \fld(S^1)} \fld(C;a,c) \tp_c \fld(C;c,b).\ee
Physically, this says that we can think of any cylinder as sum of stacks of two cylinders, provided that we mod out by the internal degrees of freedom living along the cut where the two cylinders are joined together. 

Additionally, two field configurations on the manifolds $M$ and $N$ can only be glued together along a manifold $S$ if their spin structures are compatible on $S$. That is, if we have two superspaces $\fld^\alpha(M)$ and $\fld^\beta(N)$ for $\alpha \in H^1(M,\zt), \beta\in H^1(N,\zt)$, then their tensor product satisfies
\be \fld^\alpha(M) \tp_{\fld(S)} \fld^\beta(N) \cong \bigoplus_{\gamma \in H^1(S,\zt)} \left( \fld^\alpha(M) \tp_{\fld^{\gamma}(S)} \fld^\beta(N) \right)  \delta_{\alpha|_S,\gamma}\delta_{\beta|_S,\gamma}.\ee

Consider a plane with $n$ different well-separated topological quasiparticles. As mentioned earlier, since the quasiparticles represent excitations above the usual ground-state field configurations, we can represent them as punctures in the spatial manifold, with the quasiparticle at a given puncture being defined in terms of the flux through the puncture and the puncture's boundary conditions. So then for us the relevant space of field configurations to consider is $\fld(S^2_n)$, where $S^2_n$ is the $n$-punctured $2$-sphere. 

We can now consider acting on $\fld(S^2_n)$ with the ``RG transformations'' described earlier. Under the RG flow, extra space is fused into / deleted from the area around the punctures, which is equivalent to gluing in cylinders (or tubes, or fubes) to the punctures, which by $\fld(C) = \fld(S^1)^*$, is equivalent to hitting all the field configurations on the punctures with elements of $\End(\fld(S^1))$. Thus, the effect of the RG-transformations on our $n$-punctured sphere can be encapsulated by a mapping 
\be RG: [\fld(C)]^n \ra \End(\fld(S^2_n)).\ee

However, not all elements in $\End(\fld(S^2_n))$ are physically allowable for the image of $[\fld(C)]^n$ under $RG$. Since the quasiparticles localized around each puncture are topological they are scale-invariant (we are working in gapped phases and setting the correlation length $\xi = 0$), and so the vector space of field configurations on $S^2_n$ needs to be invariant under the action of $RG$. 
That is, $RG$ transformations need to act as isomorphisms on $\fld(S^2_n)$, and so we actually have the more restricted condition that 
\be RG : [\fld(C)]^n \ra \Aut(\fld(S^2_n)). \ee

In what follows we will set $n=1$ to restrict our attention to how a single puncture is transformed under $RG$, which we can do without loss of generality. The image of $\fld(C)$ under the map $RG: \fld(C) \ra \text{Aut}(\fld(C))$ can be thought of as the formal definition of the fube algebra, namely the algebra whose scalars are drawn from $\cc$ and whose multiplication rule corresponds to the composition of maps in $\Aut(\fld(C))$, which is physically given by the stacking of fubes accomplished in the style of \eqref{eq:tuberes}. We will write the fube algebra as $\fube$ for lack of better notation. Since we have a way to associate elements in $\fube$ with automorphisms of $\fld(C)$, $\fld(C)$ is a $\fube$-module.

%Since all the elements in $\fube$ are isomorphisms on $\fld(C)$, $\fube$ is a ``representation'' of $\fld(S^2_1)$. The word ``representation'' is in quotes because $\fube$ isn't a group; it's actually an algebra, and so the more precise wording is to say that $\fld(C)$ is a $\fube$-{\it module}.% (for details on modules, see \S \ref{sec:morita}). 

Now we are prepared to discuss how to obtain the quasiparticle spectrum of the theory. Because $\fld(C)$ is a $\fube$-module, we can always decompose it into a direct sum of simple modules as
\be \fld(C) = \bigoplus_a \fld_a(C),\ee
which is just like our ability to decompose any representation into a direct sum of irreps. The simple modules $\fld_a(C)$ are the smallest vector spaces left invariant under the RG-flow induced by the action of $\fube$, and can thus be identified with the simple topological quasiparticles in the theory. 

We can also take a dual point of view with regards to the quasiparticles, and think of them as functions on $\fld(C)$, rather than as the simple sub-modules of $\fld(C)$. In this way of thinking, we define the maps $\Pi_a$ to be the canonical projectors from $\fld(C)$ to each of its submodules:
\be \Pi_a : \fld(C) \twoheadrightarrow \fld_a(C).\ee
We thus see that the $\Pi_a$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the simple modules of $\fld(C)$. In physical terms, the $\Pi_a$ are the idempotents which project onto states in which an $a$ quasiparticle is present. They are orthogonal:
\be \Pi_a \Pi_b \fld(C) = \delta_{ab}\fld_a(C)\ee
and are also central, since for any $f\in \fube$, we have 
\be f\Pi_a \fld(C) = f\fld_a(C) = \fld_a(C),\qquad \Pi_a f \fld(C) = \Pi_a \fld(C) = \fld_a(C),\ee
since $\fld(C)$ and by extension its simple submodules $\fld_a(C)$ are invariant under the action of $\fube$ by definition. 

\subsection{Finding the quasiparticle fusion rules}

Now that we've seen how to obtain the simple modules (central idempotents) and compute the quasiparticle spectrum, it's time to figure out how to derive the quasiparticle fusion rules.

Since quasiparticles are given by field configurations defined on copies of $S^1$s, the pair of pants bordism governs their fusion. If $Y$ is the pair of pants, then the field configurations come equipped with a natural action of $\fube \tp \fube \cong \Aut(\fld(S^2_2))$ from the left and $\fube \cong \Aut(\fld(C))$ from the right.\footnote{talking the talk, we would say that this makes $\fld(Y)$ into a $\fube^{\tp 2} - \fube$ bimodule.} Explicitly, for any $F,G \in \fube$, we can define a left action $(F \tp G) \fld(Y) \xrightarrow{\sim} \fld(Y)$ by stacking the superposition of tubes $F\tp G$ on top of $Y$, and for any $F \in \fube$ we can define a right action $\fld(Y) F \xrightarrow{\sim}  \fld(Y)$ by stacking the tubes $F$ onto the bottom of $Y$. Schematically, these actions look like 

%\be (F\tp G) f = \mathord{\vcenter{\hbox{\includegraphics[scale=1.1]{piapibpop.pdf}}}},\quad f\in \fld(Y),\;F,G\in \fube\ee
and
\be fF =  \mathord{\vcenter{\hbox{\includegraphics[scale=1.1]{picpop.pdf}}}}\quad f\in \fld(Y),\; F\in\fube.\ee

Since we want the fusion space of two quasiparticles $a$ and $b$ to be invariant under hitting the top legs of the pants with $\Pi_a$ and $\Pi_b$, we define the fusion space $\fld_{a\tp b}(Y)$ as the smallest nonzero vector space such that 
\be (\Pi_a\tp \Pi_b)\fld_{a\tp b}(Y) = \fld_{a\tp b}(Y)\ee
and 
\be \fld_{a\tp b}(Y)\Pi_{a\tp b}= \fld_{a\tp b}(Y),\ee
where $\Pi_{a\tp b}$ is the (not necessarily primitive) idempotent which projects onto the vector space $\fld_a(C)\tp \fld_b(C)$. 

At a formal level then, the contents of the fusion space $\fld_{a\tp b}(Y)$ can be computed by formally taking the tensor product of modules $\fld_a(C)\tp \fld_b(C)$. This algebraic approach is occasionally useful, but in practice, there is a better way to compute $\fld_{a\tp b}(Y)$, namely by writing down the smallest collection of independent field configurations on $Y$ that are mapped to themselves under stacking $\Pi_a$ and $\Pi_b$ fubes on top of the pants. 

A few more miscellaneous comments. First, note that if the theory possesses non-Abelian quasiparticles, $\fld_{a\tp b}(Y)$ will generically not be one-dimensional. Additionally, while we haven't talked about fermions much yet, $\fld_{a\tp b}(Y)$ should always be thought of as a superspace -- like all the other vector spaces considered so far, it admits a decomposition into fermion-parity even and fermion-parity odd sectors. This opens up the possibility of having more structured fusion spaces: in bosonic theories, a generic fusion space is of the form $\cc^n$, whereas in fermionic theories it is $\cc^{n|m}$, depending on the number of even and odd basis vectors that generate $\fld_{a\tp b}(Y)$. \ethan{Naively, one might think that the larger fusion spaces (and their possible non-abelian structure) could find applications in quantum information/quantum computating. }


Of course, forming the vector space $\fld_{a\tp b}(Y)$ is only half the battle, since we would like to express the fusion product $a\tp b$ in terms of other quasiparticles in the theory. This can be done by resolving the idempotent $\Pi_{a\tp b}$ as a collection of primitive idempotents. To illustrate why this is the correct strategy, we exploit the following decomposition of $\fld_{a\tp b}(Y)$ into a direct sum 
%\be \fld_{a\tp b}(Y) = \bigoplus_{c_i} \fld_{c_i}(C),\ee
\be \fld_{a\tp b}(Y) \cong \bigoplus_{c} \fld_{a\tp b}(Y) \tp_{\fld(S^1)} \fld_c(C),\ee
where the sum is over all quasiparticles $c$ and as before, $\fld_{a\tp b}(Y) \tp_{\fld(S^1)} \fld_c(C)$ means ``glue the field configurations in $\fld_{a\tp b}(Y)$ on top of the field configurations in $\fld_c(C)$ and mod out by the space of field configurations on the $S^1$ that you used to do the gluing''. To figure out what $a\tp b$ is, we need to figure out what the fields $\fld_{c}(C)$ on the bottom leg of the pants are. But this is actually very straightforward: using the decomposition above, we see that we just have to compute $\fld_{a\tp b}(Y) \Pi_c$, where $\Pi_c$ runs over all primitive idempotents. Each time a product $\fld_{a\tp b}(Y) \Pi_c$ is nonzero, the quasiparticle $c$ is in the fusion product $a\tp b$, since then the space $\fld_c(C)$ admits a nonzero gluing with $\fld_{a\tp b}(Y)$. The number of times $c$ appears in $a\tp b$ is given by the fusion multiplicity
\be N^{ab}_c = \dim [\fld_{a\tp b}(Y) \Pi_c].\ee 
Note that in general, this will be a super-dimension, and will thus decompose as a sum $N^{ab}_c= [N^{ab}_c]^0 + [N^{ab}_c]^1$.

To run through an example of this, let's work out the toric code, as it is diagrammatically similar to the Ising theory we'll be addressing later. The vector space $\fld(C)$ is four-dimensional:
\be \fld(C) = \left\langle\; \FubeXXX\;, \FubesXs\;,\FubeXss\;, \FubessX\;\right\rangle.\ee

The quasiparticles are found by computing the simple modules (or idempotents) of $\fld(C)$. A quick look at the tube algebra tells us that it is Abelian and possesses a $\zt^2$ group algebra structure, and so its simple modules will all have only one basis vector and will biject onto the group elements of $\zt^2$. Explicitly, we label them as 
\be \fld_\unit(C) =  \FubeXXX + \FubesXs,\qquad \fld_m(C) =  \FubeXXX - \FubesXs,\ee
\be \fld_e(C) = \FubeXss + \FubessX, \qquad \fld_\psi(C) =\FubeXss - \FubessX \ee
In what follows, we will occasionally abuse notation somewhat by writing the vector space $\fld_a(C)$ as $a$. 

The fusion rules can now be calculated according the prescription outlined above. 
As an example, let's calculate the fusion product $e\tp e$. First, we need to find a linear combination of pants that are invariant under the action of $\Pi_e$ on the incoming pant legs. This is pretty straightforward, following the procedure outlined above: we simply take linear combinations of tensor products (superpositions) of tubes in $e$, connect them to form tubes in $e\tp e$, and add any extra allowable pictures on the remaining space of the pair of pants, which ensures that the space $e\tp e$ is invariant under the action of $\Pi_e \tp \Pi_e$. Thus, our initial guess for the basis vector for the fusion space $e\tp e$ is
\be \begin{aligned} \fld_{e\tp e}(Y) & = \left\langle \qqo + \qqm +\qtqo +\qtqm \right. \\ & \left. + \qqto +\qqtm+ \qtqto + \qtqtm\right\rangle. \end{aligned} \ee
However, not all of these pictures are independent, and thus the above linear combination of field configurations isn't actually an element in $\fld_{e\tp e}(Y)$, since $\fld_{e\tp e}(Y)$ is defined as field configurations on $Y$ modulo local relations. Explicitly, these relations are 
\be \label{eq:pantsrelns} \qtqtm \cong \qqo,\ee
\be \qtqm \cong \qqto,\ee
\be \qqtm \cong \qtqo,\ee
\be \qqm \cong \qtqto.\ee

Now we ask what sort of particles can result from the fusion. As mentioned earlier, they can be obtained by finding the idempotents $\Pi_c$ which, when acting on the bottom puncture of the pants as $\fld_{e\tp e}(Y) \Pi_c$, leave the basis vector for $e\tp e$ invariant. Since tubes fusing onto the bottom puncture can't have any charge degree of freedom, the fusion product must be either $\unit,m$, or some linear combination thereof. We therefore need to investigate what happens to the basis vector for $e\tp e$ when we fuse in a flux loop on the bottom leg, which can be done by examining the relations \eqref{eq:pantsrelns}. We see that since fusing in flux loops leaves the basis vector of $\fld_{e\tp e}(Y)$ invariant, $m$ can't be in $\fld_{e\tp e}(Y)$, since $\fld_{e\tp e}(Y) \Pi_m = 0$. However, we see that $\unit$ does work and that $\fld_{e\tp e}(Y) \Pi_\unit = \fld_{e\tp e}(Y)$, and so we've verified $e\tp e = \unit$. 

The other fusion rules are obtained in a similar fashion. For example, the basis vector for the vector space $\fld_{e\tp \psi}(Y)$ is 
\be \fld_{e\tp \psi}(Y) = \left\langle \qqo + \qtqo - \qqto - \qtqto\right\rangle. \ee
Using \eqref{eq:pantsrelns}, we see that in order to get the signs to work out so that the basis vector is left invariant, we need flux loops to be fused in with an extra minus sign. Therefore, we confirm that $e\tp \psi = m$.

\subsubsection{Kitaev wire}
Here we propose a simple application of the above diagrammatic calculus. 
We will re-write the Kitaev-Majorana chain using this basis. 
The idea is to write down the natural anyon spin chain with this calculus and realize that it's exactly the Kitaev-Majorana chain. 
This elucidates the connection between Majorana zero modes and Ising anyons. 

The local ``on site" Hilbert space is spanned by two basis vectors
\begin{align}
    \CupSigma \qquad \text{and} \qquad \CupSigmadot
\end{align}
the first has even fermion parity, while the second has odd fermion parity.
The only terms one can contruct a Hamiltonian out of are
\begin{align}
\Id \qquad \text{and} \qquad \TwoLinedotdot
\end{align}
the first is the identity line, while the second is nontrivial and should be identified with $i \gamma_1 \gamma_2$, a Majorana bi-linear.
To see this, we can just check the action of the Hamiltonian on the basis vectors. 
\begin{align}
\TwoLinedotdot\; \times \; \CupSigma \; =\;  \CupSigma \quad \text{and} \quad \TwoLinedotdot\; \times \; \CupSigmadot \; =\;   - \; \CupSigmadot
\end{align}
\dave{Need to define ordering on vertices properly. I've been doing it by labeling the states first, then the operators have a natural ordering on them and I just begin counting from the last fermion on the state.}
For an $N$-site chain we have the basis of states,
\begin{align}
&\CupSigma \; \CupSigma \; \CupSigma \cdots \CupSigma\\
&\CupSigmadot \; \CupSigma \; \CupSigma \cdots \CupSigma\\
&\CupSigma \; \CupSigmadot \; \CupSigma \cdots \CupSigma\\
&\CupSigma \; \CupSigma \; \CupSigmadot \cdots \CupSigma\\
&\CupSigma \; \CupSigma \; \CupSigma \cdots \CupSigmadot\\
&\CupSigmadot \; \CupSigmadot \; \CupSigma \cdots \CupSigma
\end{align}
etcetera. Where there are $N$ cups appearing, and the fermion dots are ordered from right to left, and any number of them can appear.
If a state has an odd number of dots it has odd fermion parity, while an even number of dots has even fermion parity.
The Hamiltonian has two types of terms. One term mixes the states on site -- or within a single cup, while the other mixes nearest neighbour cups.
We will denote the onsite Hamiltonian terms by $H_{2j}$ and the the term which couples the nearest neighbour cups by $H_{2j+1}$.
Then the Hamiltonian takes on the form,
\begin{align}
H = - \sum_j\; t_j \; \;  \TwoLinedotdot_{\text{site $j$}}
\end{align}
Now in the completely staggered limit it's easy to see what the ground states are,
\begin{align}
\StaggaredGSEven \; \cdots \; \StaggaredGSEvenR  
\qquad \text{and} \qquad 
\StaggaredGSOdd \; \cdots  \; \StaggaredGSEvenR
\end{align}
The first differing from the second by fermion parity.
Excitations are built by putting dots on the intermediate cups. 
A nice feature of the diagrammatic notation is that the ``delocalization" of femrion number is made manifest.
For example the fermion odd state does not have a femrion localized at either end, rather its free to slide from one end to the other.
When transforming back to the original basis, one sees that the state is actually an even superposition of all possible placements of an even number of fermions, similarly for the odd state.
