~/project $ git init
~/project $ git add .
~/project $ git commit -m "first commit"
~/project $ cd ~/Dropbox/git

~/Dropbox/git $ git init --bare project.git
~/Dropbox/git $ cd ~/project

~/project $ git remote add origin ~/Dropbox/git/project.git
~/project $ git push -u origin master

clone this to other machines: git clone ~/Dropbox/git/project.git

Notes:
*Always close the .tex file before committing.*
*It is useful to use a newline for every sentence. This makes conflicting commits easier to resolve. 

Step by step:
- It's a good policy to always pull all data before making edits. (git pull origin master)
- make edits, to tex file, add figures (with git add), etc. 
- after finishing all edits do a 'git commit -am "notes on edits."', this will commit all changes to the repository
- follow this by a 'git push origin master', this will push all changes.
- repeat as necessary. 

Commands:
- pull all previous content: git pull origin master 
- add a figure/document: git add file.pdf
- make a commit: git commit -am "notes on commit, e.g., made blahh changes"
- push a commit: git push origin master

Supplementing:
GitX is useful for monitering changes.
